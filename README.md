**The New Haven Report Card Version 2.0**

This is the repository for the New Haven Report Card. The New Haven Report Card was originally built as part of the [2015 Yale Data Hack](http://yaledatahack.strikingly.com). Its purpose is to inform city officials and the public alike about the concerns of New Haven residents and the city's progress in addressing those concerns.
