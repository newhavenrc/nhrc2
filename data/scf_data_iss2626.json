However, most recently I was there Friday morning September 12th, and there were cardboard pallets, clothes, a massive pile of very used toilet paper (yuck!) and a lot of trash. The park bench seems to be the epicenter, but it is clearly someone's favorite spot at night. \n\nI don't know if this venue is the appropriate one to advise people, but I figured you could alert the city or the University about the issue. It's not a nice sight for people visiting the city or the Cemetery to see as they walk there.

Many students and parents are fearful that the city/school policy of requiring students to traverse this dangerously isolated trail in order to participate in their school sports events could end in more tragedy. Some scared girls would rather risk getting hit by a car by walking on curvy English Drive just to avoid the trail. The school offers no transportation or protection to & from the daily practices and home games for both the girls and boys sports teams that have to use Rice Field. I physically checked again yesterday and the students are still completely unmonitored and unescorted. Some travel in groups and some arrive from other schools to play and still have walk alone and unprotected.\n\nOur thinking is that short of an escort or some form of official transportation, the students remain exposed to the myriad dangers that this path to Rice Field presents. At minimum, the route should be monitored by either a school guard/official or a NHPD bicycle patrol during the time frame in which it is necessary for our students to travel it.* This seems a small concession given the area's troubled history and the fact that these are adolescents including females, some as young as fourteen years old, that are expected to navigate this deceptively dangerous and isolated place.\n\nFuture incidents are completely preventable. We're sure there are other ideas on how to stop this from ever happening again and we're interested in hearing them...one question we have is why is Cross unable or unwilling to schedule sharing their on-site football field and/or complex with soccer teams like most other High Schools?\n\nAgain, your attention to the matter is very, very much appreciated. Please keep us informed of any developments here.\n\n*Cross generally gets out at 2:00 and students start walking from the school, down Orange St. to Rice Field at about 2:15 for daily practice or pre home game warm ups (games start at 3:45 and end at about 6 when some students walk back on the trail)\n\nContacts: WCHS PRINCIPAL: <edith.johnson@new-haven.k12.ct.us>,\n\nNHPS' Superintendent: <garth.harries@new-haven.k12.ct.us>,\n\nNHPS' SECURITY: <dwight.ware@new-haven.k12.ct.us>,\n\nNHPS' Transportation: <teddi.barra@new-haven.k12.ct.us>,\n\nSincerely, concerned Parents and Taxpayers ", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.905641, 41.325035]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/795213", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories_trans/no-image.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2013-10-22T15:04:11-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/188mrDJ", "updated_at": "2013-10-26T07:49:23-04:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/795213", "summary": "Policing Issue", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/795213/flag", "address": "White Trail New Haven, CT 06511, USA", "lat": 41.325035, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.905641, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "An anonymous SeeClickFix user", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/anonymous-avatar-150x150.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/anonymous-avatar-100x100-34d41f0b4813c29efe18b16f083e0b09.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 795213, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/795213/comments"}, {"status": "Open", "rating": 10, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/792191/close"}, "description": "He is getting he money for drugs and is buying it from a man at Cedar Hill's Columbus house on State Street. \r\nThe dealer is the man with the bandage around his head like a cartoon toothache bandage. \r\n\r\nI never compained because I felt bad for him untill I saw the drug deal and another person over here saw it to.

Malloy, Senator Blumenthal, and US Attorney Stein. We did not receive a response back from any of these individuals to comment on our concerns. We have 2 foreclosures in our condo because the owners could not take the crimes committed and rapid drug dealer in our complex with no response from our police department, so they just give up and let their condos go. Our unit owners are scared to let their children play outside due to the fear of the rapid drug dealing and the quality of life. NHPD has abandoned the residences of Quinnipiac Ave and let the drug dealers deal drugs with complete immunity.

But if my grandma were biking in NH, she might feel threatened by them, and that is what concerns me. NH cyclists should feel safe and secure from cars but also fellow cyclists.

If they have tinted windows, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they have a loud muffler, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they are playing loud music, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. I guarantee the results of following these very basic procedures will be noticed by ALL the City of New Haven residents and its out of town visitors. The people who value life and want a decent quality of life will be very appreciative. \r\n\r\nYou say you cannot because you are undermanned/understaffed. Not true. You need to restructure your department. It is as simple as that. You also need to get your priorities straight. Why do we see countless officers all over town watching construction workers doing their jobs? Or, directing traffic like a flagman, at best? You say safety. Not true. Why not hire a real flagger who has been trained? Half the time these officers are sitting in their cars talking on their cell phones. Lately, we have seen not one cop at each construction site, but two, usually sitting around talking and not paying attention. All of these officers could, and SHOULD, be driving around pulling people over for the above mentioned quality of life and traffic offenses. Simple as that. Again, if they have tinted windows, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they have a loud muffler, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they are playing loud music, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. The procedure is simple and effective and has years of use behind it to back up its effectiveness. \r\n\r\nIf you follow this simple plan that I have spelled out above (it doesn't require much brain matter), it is certain that this little town of 124,000 people can return to some degree of normalcy before the summer really gets going. I am sure there are many other New Haven residents out there that would agree with me. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nA New Haven Resident", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.924373, 41.3013543]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/32731", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/signs.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2010-04-20T20:22:35-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/9xYQFW", "updated_at": "2014-02-11T16:20:24-05:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/32731", "summary": "Quality of Life Issues, Traffic Enforcement, and Crime", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/32731/flag", "address": "1 Union Avenue New Haven, CT 06519, USA", "lat": 41.3013543, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.924373, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "New Haven Resident", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 32731, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/32731/comments"}, {"status": "Open", "rating": 21, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/24729/close"}, "description": "Please post here if you have more information about the shooting.
