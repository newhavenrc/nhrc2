Surely, one of the current utility companies that conducts business in New Haven is responsible for this pole, but at this point my wife and I need help before it comes down and destroys our garage.

The noise from the immense amount of traffic at the merge is very bothersome to those of us living along the end of Wooster St, especially as large trucks slow down to handle the ramps.

The creation of such Free Drug Zones would alleviate some of the problems associated with the War on Drugs by obviating the violent enforcement of anti-drug laws and by putting local dealers out of business, thereby precluding them from having to resort to violence for their own protection.

That would make it difficult for the thieves to identify which homes have a (real) package and those that are empty. It strikes me that the thieves want to move quickly; if we're adding lots of boxes, it slows them down, and it increases the chances that one of us will see them. If enough of us do this, it may make theft unprofitable since the thieves will faced with a higher chance of being caught and a higher chance of scoring an empty box. Any other ideas welcome, but I'll be putting out boxes in the morning and on random days thereafter.

The terms of this assignment as as follows: \r\n\r\n>  It might incorporate the existing plastic items\r\n>  It might include electronics (sensors especially)\r\n>  It should be durable to withstand the elements\r\n>  It should be cheap to manufacture\r\n>  It must be seen as an improvement to the original design\r\n\r\nIn the event that the design is successful, there are tons of towns and municipalities of all shapes and sizes which might be interested in trying out this type of civic improvement in their downtown sidewalks.  If the design succeeds and these organizations become interested in implementing this design, maybe it will keep #nhv on the map for cool inventions, and would be a great way to connect two great organizations (SeeClickFix and MakeHaven). \r\n\r\nGood Luck!  Nhv.Org will be reporting on the success of this project in high-definition 720p.

I believe she was talking on her phone, minding her business.\r\n\r\nAt that point, a recognizable See Click Fix user (A Jane Jacobs, in fact) was walking by.  Noticing the woman in the car (and apparently not the huge city van) this SCF user turned around, made eye contact with the citizen in the sedan, and pointed to what looked to be a city sign (which probably indicated that this area is no longer used for parking like it once was).\r\n\r\nThe SCF user stood there for about 5 seconds, pointing at the sign and making eye contact.

You don't need a lot to make that a nice space- the river and marina view is enough.  \r\n\r\nWe desperately need a coffee shop that opens early in the morning, before 9am; a good small market; and a convenience store.

Please vote here if you want to see this problem addressed and if you agree: \r\n\r\n1. Every citizen has the right to freedom from fear: a safe neighborhood and a safe house.\r\n\r\n2. No child living in New Haven or anywhere else nearby should have to hear gunshots every week in their neighborhood (I currently do!).\r\n\r\n3. A friend recently said \"it is easier to get a gun than a quart of milk in my neighborhood.\" This is obviously not an acceptable situation.\r\n\r\n4. A comprehensive community strategy is needed to stop the violence. Elected representatives should be able to explain exactly what they are doing to support the community's strategy.\r\n\r\n5. The constant outdoor gunfire at the police training range is not acceptable. People living in Newhallville and Beaver Hills hear constant gunfire from this range and it sends the wrong message.\r\n\r\nPlease post ideas for community organizing to stop the message, links to relevant pages, etc -- and send the message to everyone that enough is enough!\r\n\r\nRelated articles:\r\nhttp://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/bike_enthusiast_shot_dead/\r\nhttp://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/murder_in_the_hill/\r\nhttp://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/coffe_crueller_and_a_chair/\r\nhttp://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/murder_on_button_st/\r\nhttp://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/double_homicide_on_front_st/\r\nhttp://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/while_friend_clings_to_life_shooting_/\r\nhttp://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/another_year_no_white_/", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.9249501228333, 41.3072053560064]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/90790", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories_trans/no-image.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2011-03-25T12:58:21-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/f0sFMQ", "updated_at": "2014-02-20T13:13:47-05:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/90790", "summary": "Petition: Stop the Violence in New Haven", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/90790/flag", "address": "157 Church St New Haven, CT 06510, USA", "lat": 41.3072053560064, "closed_at": "2013-03-27T06:41:09-04:00", "lng": -72.9249501228333, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "Anonymous", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 90790, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/90790/comments"}, {"status": "Open", "rating": 21, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/89906/close"}, "description": "If you rent, and have \"on street\" parking, you are very likely to somehow, at some point, be snarled into some ridiculous appeals process to get the original parking/towing ticket thrown out, especially if you feel your property was seized unjustly.

So at the risk of being bounced off - I am going to give it a try.\r\n\r\nI run a support and educational group for Diabetes. I myself have problems. I moved here in 2007 and was appauled at the lack of health care support here comparitively.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for Diabetics, there is only one free clinic and that is only for that section of New Haven residents, there are no free pharmacy clinics. My shock comes from the fact that Connecticut has soooo many colleges and the biggest \"enterprise\" is Yale. Yet hardly anything is given back to the community here.  \r\n\r\nWe need more health care access to those who desperately need it. Its a shame that when I came to Connecticut I had no insurance at first but needed a perscription refill I had no other choice (exhausting all information) but to go to the ER for it. For absolutely NO SERVICES what so ever, waited three hours to spend less then 2 minutes with a doctor who wrote me a perscript based on my medical records I brought with me - cost? $541  This is absolutely absurd!  Not only the cost but the fact that I had to resort to the ER to do it. \r\n\r\nThe other saddest thing is that I don't qualify for state aid because I have no children and am not married. All I need and want are my routine blood tests done and revaluation of my meds. I am not one who gets sick, who needs medical attention nor who runs to the ER for every scratch and booboo. I take very good care of myself, educate others on the same and live a healthy lifestyle. But I cant afford to get my blood work done to see if my medications need tweeked. \r\n\r\nI need your help - your voice - in chiming in to demand more free clinics, a free pharmacy and a Diabetic and Endocrine resource center. I have come up with a great plan to help with these clinics to take off the financial burdan of the state. We need the public to come forth and demand it. To push for it. To help finding solutions.
