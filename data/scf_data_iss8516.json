Your administration has done nothing to help out with the snow removal in this city. People from your office post here that they are constantly working on the issue, but all I have seen is a plow going down streets from time to time, pushing all the snow up next to parked cars, blocking them in. Driving, biking, and walking in this city has become a nightmare. On Orange close to the housing authority, there has been a large mound of snow blocking part of the northbound lane for two weeks now, forcing cars in that lane to use the southbound lane. Pearl and Eld, used by a lot of people trying to get to and from Orange and State, are an absolute disaster because people cannot park easily and leave the front or back ends of their cars out in the streets. Emergency personal have said that in many of the East Rock streets it is literally impossible for an ambulance or a fire truck to fit. Humphrey is an accident waiting to happen, considering how blocked it has become and how quickly people try to drive on it. And it's not just the East Rock neighborhood -- it's everywhere. You have taken little to no action on this issue, and you have proven yourself a disgrace. You make few public appearances, and people complain constantly that they never see you or know what you are up to. You are a failure of a mayor, and your response to this issue, despite the constant outcries from the people, has been to ignore it. The former mayor figured out what to do when there was a mess left after a huge snowstorm, so why can't you? Now that some of this is thawing, the streets and sidewalks are inches deep in water in places, and tonight they will turn into an ice skating rink.

My driver side mirror was broken/shattered, the side of the car is scraped up, the rear of the car was bent/broken in, and the tire was cut. I blame this on poor snow removal on our street. \r\n\r\nMany of us only have street parking and we're doing our best to find legal parking spaces and park as close to the curb as possible, but even on the odd side (which is where my car was), which is supposed to be plowed by the city, you have to park on a mountain of snow to get close to the curb. Cars can barely get down the street (made more narrow by the snow), so situations like mine are bound to happen.\r\n\r\nThe damage to my car is almost 3k and there was no note or effort made to contact me. The city needs to take better care of its residents (who are paying to park on the street) so that they're not the victim of similar incidents. Mind you, I realize that these situations can happen in the summer, but the parking situation due to the snow has been really ridiculous this season and this incident was the straw that broke the camel's back.", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.9153804, 41.3147094]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1502800", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories_trans/no-image.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2015-02-25T15:10:30-05:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/1FtJ3kv", "updated_at": "2015-02-26T13:25:06-05:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1502800", "summary": "SNOW RELATED", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1502800/flag", "address": "Clark Street New Haven, Connecticut", "lat": 41.3147094, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9153804, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "An anonymous SeeClickFix user", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/anonymous-avatar-150x150.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/anonymous-avatar-100x100-34d41f0b4813c29efe18b16f083e0b09.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 1502800, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1502800/comments"}, {"status": "Acknowledged", "rating": 5, "transitions": {}, "description": "Coming from Westville on Whalley, snow piled very high.

street between the hours of 1AM and 5 AM? This is the second year in a row that this has happened, and it is extremely bothersome to the many nearby residents/families who are trying to sleep between these hours, as I'm sure all of us are. The constantly flashing light on the vehicle, the beep-beep-beep of the vehicle in reverse, not to mention the sound of metal scraping along pavement, make it impossible to sleep. As I watched them proceed, as i couldn't sleep, I couldn't even tell what exactly the point this was.  The snow and ice have been melting just fine. Maybe put down some salt?  Please just do anything besides this insane noise violation in the earliest hours of the morning.

I have announced a downtown and residential area parking ban, effective from 2 AM Sunday morning. This includes all posted snow routes, and 25\u2019 from any intersection, fire hydrant or bus stop. The downtown ban will end tomorrow at 2 PM and the residential, posted snow routes, intersections, fire hydrant, and bus stop ban will end Monday morning at 6 AM. Free alternative parking is available in New Haven Public Schools parking lots, city park parking lots, the Granite Square parking garage, and in the Temple Street parking garage for a $3 fee. Residents are also reminded that residential parking remains permissible on the even-numbered side of city streets. New Haven residents can direct all storm related inquires to the city\u2019s Emergency Operations Center at 203-946-8221. We will continue to work together to minimize the inconvenience and disruptive potential of this storm, and maximize public safety.

This issue happens every year, because cars don't think that they will be towed, because they aren't, and so they continue to park \"against emergency orders\".  Last year a van parked in front of our home for 4 weeks, completely snow and ice packed, and I notified the proper departments, but the issue continued, and an elderly family member fell on the hazardous conditions caused by the \"illegally parked van, the snow, and the ice issues\" caused by the van.  I certainly would NOT like to see someone get towed, because they did not move their vehicle, but if everyone is expected to follow the rules, then THAT helps everyone in the long run.  Thank you.
