If anything it made the situation worse.   This is a dangerous, congested, ill conceived, unnecessarily large intersection that is unfriendly to walkers an cyclists.  The median for the bus puts pedestrians in the middle of a busy sometimes congested intersection. The design of this intersection creates congestion on lawn crest.  Ideally the end of Lawn Crest and the  west side of the intersection would be converted to community to community Green space to reduce congestion and provide traffic calming.  Traffic would then be diverted to the intersection of Ramsdell and Fairfield which is better designed.  At a minimum the 50' section of Lawncrest that intersects with Fountain should be blocked off , bringing Lawncrest to a right angle stop with Ramsdell (making Ramsdell a 2-way street at Fountain).", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.97922572726134, 41.32906767239203]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1568327", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/traffic.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2015-04-02T08:15:26-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/1NDEcQL", "updated_at": "2015-04-02T11:12:27-04:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1568327", "summary": "Public Space, Streets and Drains", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1568327/flag", "address": "2-26 Lawncrest Road New Haven, Connecticut", "lat": 41.329067672392, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9792257272613, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "Bill T", "witty_title": "Municipal Avenger", "civic_points": 625, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100-0e1ba3fad46692e1a3e9a4b333e91ce5.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100-0e1ba3fad46692e1a3e9a4b333e91ce5.png"}, "id": 871226}, "id": 1568327, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1568327/comments"}, {"status": "Open", "rating": 4, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1567039/close"}, "description": "3 different homeless panhandling on this street today.

roads following construction, most notably on High Street which for the past decade has resembled the siege of Vicksburg.\nNew Haven Code of Ordinances (Article III, Ch.27, Sec27-71 through 27-84)  is clear that street excavations have to be patched to the specs for the street and the repairs cannot fail for at least several years.\n\nIssue : Yale has (most probably without permission) taken it upon themselves to paint a crosswalk midblock on High Street (btwn Chapel and Elm) with the daily net effect of an elderly person standing in the middle of the street focusing his or her camera on Harkness tower, unaware of impending vehicles.\nCT State Statutes (Section 14-297) define a crosswalk as the extension of a public sidewalk across a street to another sidewalk. The path from Old Campus Quad to Harkness Tower fails to meet that definition.. Although the BOA was foolish enough to sell the rest of High Street, this portion still remains public property and should not be commandeered by the University.\n\nIssue: Yale has also taken it upon themselves to tamp a large pile of asphalt on the Harkness side of the street sloping from street to sidewalk. Although this resembled a handicap ramp, it fails to actually meet the ADA definition, is the inversion of a curb cut extending out into the street and therefore puts vehicles in grave danger. A peninsula of curb height pavement extending several feet out into a city street (already constricted by Yale\u2019s dorm renovations) recklessly endangers the public.\nHigh Street is public property and should not be used or abused by private entities.\n", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.9292557086136, 41.30942163190225]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1187888", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories_trans/no-image.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2014-07-16T15:47:23-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/1yswJOI", "updated_at": "2014-07-18T21:18:55-04:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1187888", "summary": "Yale Commandeers More of High Street", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1187888/flag", "address": "88 High Street New Haven, Connecticut", "lat": 41.3094216319022, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9292557086136, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "robn", "witty_title": "City Fixer", "civic_points": 2435, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/user_images/0000/4485/BUNNY2.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/user_images/0000/4485/BUNNY2_square.png"}, "id": 7568}, "id": 1187888, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1187888/comments"}, {"status": "Acknowledged", "rating": 2, "transitions": {}, "description": "Pavement surrounding the steel plate on Chapel Street near Hotchkiss Street is sinking!!

Every sidewalk in new haven gets shoveled but for some reason no one will shovel all the way to the crosswalk button and it creates a huge slipping hazard. Last year after the blizzard even though it was extreme circumstances between the plows and the amount of snow we got there was no way to walk to press the crosswalk button and you would have to jump into traffic in order to cross because the snow pile was so high you couldn't even see if someone was coming off the highway to take a right turn. It is a very dangerous intersection to begin with and if you can't get to the crosswalk button it creates an even bigger hazard to cross the street.", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.9190525855209, 41.3121777602684]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/859578", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/traffic.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2013-12-19T16:24:49-05:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/1c4Ty1a", "updated_at": "2014-01-01T12:25:38-05:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/859578", "summary": "Snow removal on sidewalk at cross walk button", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/859578/flag", "address": "425-431 Orange Street New Haven, Connecticut", "lat": 41.3121777602684, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9190525855209, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "An anonymous SeeClickFix user", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/anonymous-avatar-150x150.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/anonymous-avatar-100x100-34d41f0b4813c29efe18b16f083e0b09.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 859578, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/859578/comments"}, {"status": "Acknowledged", "rating": 5, "transitions": {}, "description": "Can your department please explain why after 24 hours the weather subsided, and homeowners finished cleaning their driveways and properties, does the snow plows pack 1 foot of snow into our cleared driveways?
