Division Street\nNew Haven, CT  06511\n(203)901-3529\nWednesday, January 14, 2015\n\n\nMr. Michael Carter, Acting Director\nCity Of New Haven (Department of Public Works)\n34 Middletown Avenue\nNew Haven, CT  06513\n203-946-7700\n\nReference:  Side Walk & Driveway\n\nGreetings;\n\nIn April of 2012 I purchased a home at 339-341 W. Division Street in New Haven.  I love my home but getting in and out of my Driveway is a major job.  The first thing is that the Driveway is very narrow and the second issue; is that my neighbors across the street who has a much wider Driveway, has five to six cars which parks along one side of the street even blocking their own Driveway.  This makes it very hard for me and my family to pull in, pull out, back in and back out if my Driveway on a regular bases. I can\u2019t even pull out of my Driveway if they have their driver side car doors open.  I have to wait on them which happen a lot.   West Division Street is already a one way street and a bit of a tight street. I\u2019m seeking your help, assistance and/or advice in this matter.\n\nNow, last but not least I purchase the corner lot property which is W. Division Street and Sherman Pkwy.  I\u2019m suggesting and seeking to move my Driveway on the side of my property to avoid the whole issue with my neighbors and the inconvenience of the whole matter.  This will also allow me to enter and exit my property on a two way street a well.  \n\nThere is no sidewalk on the Sherman Pkwy.  I was under the impression that a Sidewalk was going to be placed a while ago after speaking with Neighborhood Housing Services.  Also, seeing how the fence went down and the trees came up across the street on Sherman Pkwy, I assumed it would be part of the beautification process.  I could be mistaken and if so I\u2019m seeking your help in trying to get a side walk placed on the side of my property which has a high traffic rate/usage.   Children take the rout every day for the school bus and going to and from school each day along residents and not to forget that when the parking runs out at James Hillhouse High School for the various events that is hosted the area in questioned is used quite a bit.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could get back to me as soon as possible on his matter.  Please feel free to contact me on the number listed above.  I thank you in advance for all of your help, understanding and cooperation.  \n\n\nRespectfully Submitted,\n\n\n\nLillieadair Chambers,\nConcerned New Haven Resident\n", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.9368747, 41.3267802]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1441004", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories_trans/no-image.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2015-01-14T10:22:00-05:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/1sy4b7y", "updated_at": "2015-01-14T13:47:34-05:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1441004", "summary": "Sidewalks and Curb damage", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1441004/flag", "address": "W.
