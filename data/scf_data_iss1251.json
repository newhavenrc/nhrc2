Over front exterior entrance to 2nd floor, ends of said molding merely were filled with expanding foam, still allowing entrance of birds, squirrels, insects and water\u2014but  not repaired; \r\n\u2022\trotted, split eave boards under 2nd floor front windows (of said overhang between 1st and 2nd floor) \r\n\u2022\tAforementioned split eave boards contain a massive wasp nest, such that tenants on 2nd floor cannot open front windows in summer; \r\n\u2022\tRotted, split eave of this same overhang \u201crepaired\u201d with expanding foam: where it terminates on right side/Greenwich Ave. side of building\r\n\u2022\tRotted top-trim [lintel boards] over BOTH small windows on left, 1st floor side of building\r\n\u2022\tnew plywood eave that was added to left side of building [after original collapsed, along with much of the roof,  into neighbor\u2019s driveway] was NOT completed at front corner: it does not meet properly with the eave return\r\n\u2022\tthis entire new eave\u2014illegally installed by unlicensed contractor\u2014was   attached with drywall screws rather than exterior-grade fasteners\u2014and therefore is likely to collapse again soon; it also has not been painted or covered with siding to protect this new eave from weather damage; \r\n\u2022\tthis same new plywood eave and facia on left side of building already is water-stained at joints due to water infiltration: likely caused both by lack of gutter maintenance as well as incompetently installed new roof\r\n\u2022\tgutters not maintained: overflow when raining, because they never have been cleaned. As noted above, this also is damaging eave and facia\r\n\u2022\tRotted eave returns on the front of building were \u201crepaired\u201d in slap-dash manner by unlicensed\u2014i.e. illegal\u2014contractor ; they were not \u201ccontinued\u201d properly where they meet the side eaves; and both \u201creturns\u201d are about to collapse due to contractor\u2019s incompetence: they are barely secured to the building! This is an IMMEDIATE  hazard to pedestrians and tenants\r\n\u2022\t\u201cbuilding contains unauthorized storage or accumulation of junk, trash, rubbish, litter or refuse\u201d: behind and in front of the garages\r\n\u2022\tThe rotted door at top of rear, exterior stairway is an INterior-grade lauan door\u2014not rated for exterior use. This creates an immediate security problem for tenants\u2014and is a fire hazard.\r\n\u2022\tmany exterior clapboards are split, shedding paint [lead paint?] everywhere and allowing water infiltration; the most-heavily damaged clapboards are on left side of building; this is causing structural damage/rot to building\u2019s sill and framing and is adding to persistent mold problem inside apartments; inspector needs to examine sill from inside basement. ***HOUSING COURT and LCI should NOT resolve tenant\u2019s mold and dampness complaint [see below] until this is resolved. *** Otherwise mold remediation in apartment only will be very temporary.\r\n\u2022\tmold and algae are on window sills at building\u2019s left side\u2014due  to malfunctioning gutters and general lack of maintenance \r\n\u2022\tbirds are nesting inside furnace air-intake vents on left side of building, due to lack of  guards here to keep out birds/rodents; this is a carbon monoxide hazard!\r\n\u2022\tPlywood siding is rotted under concrete roof edge at REAR of brick/cinderblock addition (between garage and wood frame part of building): i.e. along rear, exterior wood stairway\r\n\u2022\thuge pile of dry leaves under rear, exterior wood stairway\u2014creating immediate fire hazard\r\n\u2022\trotted trim where wood of building abuts concrete sidewalk, at the angled, corner doorway of 1st floor unit numbered \u201c371\u201d [Greenwich] \r\n\u2022\t\u201cIt is a fire hazard as determined by the fire marshal, or as documented in fire department reports.\u201d About 10 days ago members of the New Haven Fire Dept. spent considerable time photographing the exterior of this building. I suspect they have a report which LCI can access.\r\nOwner Kirsten Hopes-McFadden (and \u201cagent\u201d/spouse Tillman \u201cTim\u201d McFadden) of North Haven were ordered by LCI to fix numerous problems with 2nd floor apartment of 86 Second ST. back in Oct, 2013; they were re-ordered in Feb, 2014\u2014and finally had to be taken to Housing Court this month by the tenant to commence repairs. \r\n***WHY DID LCI allow the problem to drag out so long that the tenant had no recourse but to bypass LCI\u2014and go to Housing Court for repairs to commence??***\r\n\u201cblighted lots and buildings adversely affect the city's economic well-being, and are inimical to the health, safety and welfare of the city's residents\u2026It is found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain structures and properties have the further effect of creating blighted conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the expenditures of large amounts of public funds [i.e. taxpayers money!] to correct and eliminate the same.\u201d (from Anti-blight and property maintenance ordinance; . Declaration of Policy*)\r\nIt is part of LCI\u2019s responsibilities to ENFORCE the Anti-blight ordinance. It is my hope that neighbors will not need to turn to the courts\u2014as the tenant did\u2014in order to get LCI to carry out its responsibilities as they relate to 86 Second Street. \r\nADDITIONALLY, due to owner\u2019s persistent history of hiring incompetent, unlicensed, illegal contractors to perform hazardous, makeshift repairs, LCI needs to INSIST that above-mentioned problems be repaired by a state-licensed, insured contractor\u2014as is required by CT state law. And LCI should insist on PROOF of said licensure and insurance by the contractor. It is ILLEGAL in the state of CT for contractors to be working without licensure: http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?q=274440 Note that Building officials are prohibited from issuing building permits unless they receive a copy of the contractor\u2019s valid Certificate of Registration http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?a=4308&q=507962\r\n(or Google \u201cConnecticut department of consumer protection\u201d) \r\n* New Haven, Connecticut, Code of Ordinances >> TITLE III - CODE OF GENERAL ORDINANCES >> Chapter 9 - BUILDINGS AND PROPERTY >> ARTICLE II.
