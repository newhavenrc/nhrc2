The work caused major inconvenience, from noise to a city ban on street parking, but as residents, we understood the need to be patient and the potential long-term benefits of having solid infrastructure. However, when it was time to seal the holes in the road, the construction crew did shoddy work. As a result, the road is uneven, full of poorly filled potholes, cracks and bumps. A simple slow drive to get out of the street has become a difficult and bumpy experience. Like most of my neighbors, I own a simple sedan, not an all terrain vehicle that can handle such a ride. And with small children in the back of my car, the ride has become particularly unsafe. Since Pearl St and many of its adjacent roads  - which were also badly damaged during the construction project- are one-way streets, it is practically impossible to get out of the street and into one of the main roads (e.g. State st, Orange st) without saying a prayer first. I have lived here for 3 years now, and know that the city usually repairs the roads once a year, after the winter has caused its usual damages. I also know that budget is tight. However, I can\u2019t imagine living like this through the rest of the fall and the entire winter.
