Avgas-fueled aircraft are the single largest source of lead air emissions in the country.  See Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2010. \r\n\r\nA July 2011 study from Duke University published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives supports concerns about the severe and negative public health consequences caused by lead emissions from aircraft. The report found that children living within 500 meters of an airport at which planes use leaded avgas have higher blood lead levels than other children. This effect of aircraft lead emissions on blood lead levels was also evident among children living within 1 kilometer of airports. The researchers concluded that there is a significant association between potential exposure to lead emissions from aviation gasoline and blood lead levels in children.\r\n\r\nResults of lead monitoring conducted by EPA at 17 general aviation airports around the country were announced in June 2013, confirming the existing danger and further reinforcing the need for immediate EPA action to phase out lead in avgas.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening at Tweed Airport?!?!", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.8910587, 41.268908]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1051747", "media": {"image_square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0020/8721/Screen_Shot_2014-06-17_at_12.56.25_PM.png", "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0020/8721/Screen_Shot_2014-06-17_at_12.56.25_PM.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0020/8721/Screen_Shot_2014-06-17_at_12.56.25_PM.png"}, "created_at": "2014-04-25T12:44:19-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/1jMdFl3", "updated_at": "2015-01-22T12:49:32-05:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1051747", "summary": "Health Complaints - Lead Contamination via Air Emissions at Tweed?", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1051747/flag", "address": "155 Burr St East Haven, Connecticut", "lat": 41.268908, "closed_at": "2014-11-24T11:43:36-05:00", "lng": -72.8910587, "acknowledged_at": "2014-04-28T11:25:01-04:00", "reporter": {"name": "Rachel Heerema", "witty_title": "Digital Superhero", "civic_points": 1675, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/user_images/0001/5898/810x7448.jpg", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/user_images/0001/5898/810x7448_square.jpg"}, "id": 15393}, "id": 1051747, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1051747/comments"}, {"status": "Acknowledged", "rating": 4, "transitions": {}, "description": "The entire area smell of chemicals this morning.
