I was finally forced to run the red when the other side had a green but no cars were coming, and by that time there was a very long line behind me.", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.91210748159239, 41.31413262837611]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1196650", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories_trans/no-image.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2014-07-21T10:14:29-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/1zXflDl", "updated_at": "2015-03-11T17:35:55-04:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1196650", "summary": "Traffic Signal / Pedestrian Signal", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1196650/flag", "address": "200-260 Humphrey Street New Haven, Connecticut", "lat": 41.3141326283761, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9121074815924, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "An anonymous SeeClickFix user", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/anonymous-avatar-150x150.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/anonymous-avatar-100x100-34d41f0b4813c29efe18b16f083e0b09.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 1196650, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1196650/comments"}, {"status": "Open", "rating": 4, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1196622/close"}, "description": "I've noticed this quite a few times over the years - when a car is waiting at the light to turn left out of Bruegger's parking lot to go up either Amity or Whalley, it almost always cuts in front of the traffic going straight through the intersection from Walgreens parking lot to Wright St. On the other hand, when cars attempt to drive straight through the intersection from the Brueggers parking lot to Walgreens parking lot, the left-turning traffic from Walgreens almost always cuts it off. Typical intersections have three directions to choose; this intersection has five. I think that there are too many options and factors involved for these directions to be sharing the same light signals, at least without any directional signage or oncoming traffic warnings, especially considering the vast width if this intersection. I have personally experienced too many close-calls with other drivers nearly slamming into my car when I simply attempt to drive straight across this intersection.

Every day when I go to school, I always have to cross the intersection of Whalley Ave. and Ella Grasso Blvd. \r\n\r\nI am writing to you to see if SOMETHING can be done about this intersection. First let\u2019s start how if you are heading towards Southern on Ella Grasso Blvd., there NEEDS to be a designated \u201cleft turn\u201d lane at Ella Grasso Blvd and a designated \u201cright turn/straight\u201d lane at this same intersection. I don\u2019t know how many times I have been cut off by other drivers because you have drivers that stay on the right side that go straight and cut you off, or if you are on the right side to go straight, you have drivers on the left side that go straight to cut you off. Confusing\u2026.right? I know. Which is why there needs to be these designated lanes to go in certain directions. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, any way we can make the light green longer that faces Ella Grasso Blvd. in BOTH directions? Seriously, the light is green for no more than a minute, and traffic gets backed up during rush hour in the morning and in the evening. \r\n\r\nPerhaps to get a better understanding on how annoying this intersection is, not to mention the problems of this intersection, I am wondering if someone from the traffic division can observe this intersection during rush hour commute (whether in morning or in the evening). I am fully aware that New Haven has other bigger issues, and the personnel of the police department has bigger things to deal with, but it\u2019s a matter of time before a serious accident happens. So many people are cutting people off and/or running the light because it\u2019s too short and people get impatient for waiting at the light for the fifth time in a row. As stated earlier, I have been cut off numerous times, and almost to the point where people were inches away from hitting me head on due to them running the light if they are making a left turn onto Whalley. SOMETHING needs to be done, and any effort to get this problem solved would be greatly appreciated. \r\n", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.9492833767212, 41.318916905855]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/740738", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/signs.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2013-09-12T10:59:31-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/15Uqnhl", "updated_at": "2014-09-01T23:08:52-04:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/740738", "summary": "Designated Lanes Needed/Traffic Signal longer needed", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/740738/flag", "address": "Ella Grasso Blvd And Whalley Ave New Haven, Connecticut", "lat": 41.318916905855, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9492833767212, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "Meg", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 740738, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/740738/comments"}, {"status": "Acknowledged", "rating": 11, "transitions": {}, "description": "I am writing to you to alert you of a serious situation for pedestrians at the corner of S.

Emerson and Forest. \r\nThe road divider there makes the residents of this block approach from the W-bound side of Fountain.

E-bound Fountain has a longer green than W-bound Fountain. This aggravates the traffic congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG PROBLEM #3: Traffic N on Forest Rd. backs up for 2+ blocks. At rush hour, cars can wait 10-15 minutes to get to the light.\r\n\r\n*SUGGESTION*: This intersection is complicated and heavily travelled. Why not give each direction an exclusive green? \r\n\r\nThat would make the traffic pattern (going counter-clockwise): W-bound traffic on Fountain, S-bound, traffic on Dayton, E-bound  traffic on Fountain, N-bound traffic on Forest.\r\n\r\nVista Terrace?

There is a crossing signal for pedestrians crossing Temple St. on the south side, but the vehicle traffic on Trumbull St. gets a green light at the SAME TIME and vehicles turning off Trumbull  to go south on Temple St. therefore compete with pedestrians trying to cross.  Vehicles turning off Trumbull St. gun their engines as soon as the light turns green and take direct aim at the pedestrians, who the drivers don't seem to think have any business being in their way.  Often drivers are in such a hurry that they refuse to give pedestrians the right of way.  If they do, rude drivers behind them may honk.  This signal needs to be changed so that drivers and pedestrians are not competing to get through the intersection at the SAME TIME -- that is an accident waiting to happen.
