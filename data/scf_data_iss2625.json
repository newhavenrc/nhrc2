I made the mistake of trying to commute to work on bike and had to swerve potholes and debris the entire time while worrying about traffic, buses, and poorly parked cars. This was the most unsafe ride I have ever had, anywhere - and this was supposed to be the major north/south biking artery of East Rock. \r\n\r\nAt one point, I had to try and jump a pothole and my rear tire didn't make it causing a flat tire and slightly bent rim. I am mad about my expensive commuter bike, but honestly, mostly just relieved I didn't tumble into traffic or hit my face. Some of these pot holes are more than 6 inches deep. A pothole for a car is an inconvenience with the possibility of tire/rim damage; a pothole on a bike however is a major safety concern- people have been killed like that.\r\n\r\nAll roads in East Rock are in horrible shape coming out of a long winter, understandably it will take some time to address this issue everywhere. But please, please, fix the bike lanes first. \r\n\r\nIf you are looking to commute on bike, strongly consider taking a bus or walking until roads are improved. New Haven City officials, please try riding a bike in one of these bike lanes and reporting back.\r\n\r\nI will follow up later with photos", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.91440011875738, 41.3184366112478]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1536487", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories_trans/no-image.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2015-03-17T13:40:30-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/19wrjLI", "updated_at": "2015-03-18T11:51:35-04:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1536487", "summary": "Deadly Bike Lane", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1536487/flag", "address": "671 Orange Street New Haven, Connecticut", "lat": 41.3184366112478, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9144001187574, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "Rocco", "witty_title": "Civic Crusader", "civic_points": 270, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100-0e1ba3fad46692e1a3e9a4b333e91ce5.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100-0e1ba3fad46692e1a3e9a4b333e91ce5.png"}, "id": 429333}, "id": 1536487, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1536487/comments"}, {"status": "Open", "rating": 7, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1536470/close"}, "description": "The intersection at Elm and State Street is terrifically hazardous, especially crossing from Elm Street, across State Street near the WTNH building.

Unhampered by any stop signs or lights, cars zip down the street, often ignoring posted pedestrian crosswalks. Dolores Dogolo was struck and killed in October trying to cross the street; it\u2019s now February, and nothing has been done to slow traffic or to secure additional, well-marked crosswalks. Compounding the problem now is the total lack of snow removal from sidewalk curbs; people still need to cross the street, regardless of weather. In order to do that now, we have to climb over snow or take a dangerous, circuitous path. We need new stop signs at the intersection of Court and Olive Streets.\r\n\r\nAt the neighborhood meeting last night, many of us discussed how we could slow traffic and ensure the safety of our pedestrians. A worker from the city claimed that a raised crosswalk would be too expensive; the crosswalk at Whitney and Audubon, for instance, cost $300,000. So: two new stop signs should be installed, replacing the \u201cYIELD TO PEDESTRIANS\u201d signs that are currently there and that are currently ignored. The crosswalk-sign that stays in the middle of the crosswalk until it is hit and destroyed by a car should be installed properly.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there should be crosswalks painted on all sides of the intersection; as is, only the northern crossing is painted. The sidewalks need to be prepared with proper ramps for wheelchairs and baby strollers.\r\n\r\nThis is not a cost-prohibitive project, but it is a mandatory one that must be done as soon as possible. Unfortunately for our community and for the Dogolo family, it is not proactive enough; stop signs and crosswalks should have been installed and painted long before October.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nYour neighbor,\r\nAlex", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.91988458548667, 41.30516047118052]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1493941", "media": {"image_square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0029/0298/IMG_9275_square.JPG", "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0029/0298/IMG_9275_square.JPG", "video_url": null, "image_full": "https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0029/0298/IMG_9275.JPG"}, "created_at": "2015-02-18T14:58:22-05:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/1Jq1e0z", "updated_at": "2015-03-31T16:59:50-04:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1493941", "summary": "Stop Signs and Crosswalks Needed", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1493941/flag", "address": "47 Court Street New Haven, Connecticut", "lat": 41.3051604711805, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9198845854867, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "Alex Werrell", "witty_title": "Civic Crusader", "civic_points": 385, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100-0e1ba3fad46692e1a3e9a4b333e91ce5.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100-0e1ba3fad46692e1a3e9a4b333e91ce5.png"}, "id": 918534}, "id": 1493941, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1493941/comments"}, {"status": "Open", "rating": 6, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1488923/close"}, "description": "Recently H & R Block has been posting their signs in the snow bank blocking the ability to see cars coming when pulling out onto State Street from Pearl Street.

Here are just a few. To resolve this issue, Yale, the Lincoln-Bradley Neighborhood association, the City of New Haven, and the landlords at 516-518 Orange and the building housing Cafe Romeo are going to need to work together. The LBNA has, in good faith, spent some time coming up with proposals for Pearl Street, none of which have stuck. I had hoped that when Yale was working to complete Evans Hall (new SOM building) they would have paid some attention to this wasp's nest of issues....but they didn't. \r\n\r\n1) the pathway from the back of Evans Hall empties directly into the middle of a city street with NO signage or indicators that pedestrians are now walking on a street. There should be bollards, a large sign and some kind of curb with a curb cut indicating that PEOPLE ARE WALKING IN THE MIDDLE OF A STREET. As it is now, there is a steady stream of students pouring onto Pearl St, oblivious to their surroundings talking on their phones etc. YALE - please pay attention!!!!!! You spent over a hundred million dollars on this building and it would be a shame to have one of your students injured or killed here. Also, THERE IS NO SIDEWALK ON THIS STRETCH OF PEARL STREET.\r\n\r\n2) 516-518 Orange Street continues to be a mess.\r\n\r\na) their dumpsters overflow and are frequently end up in the middle of the sidewalk - they have tried to improve this situation, but it is still far from being a good situation.\r\n\r\nb) the portion on the (too narrow) sidewalk on Pearl Street that they are responsible for cleaning is a sheet of ice. Even on the best days, this sidewalk is dangerous. The concrete is cracked and the strip of dirt between the sidewalk and the curb is usually full of broken glass and garbage that hasnt been picked up by the trash company\r\n\r\n3) the parking area on Pearl Street adjacent to Cafe Romeo's storage locker is overcrowded and usually has one or two extra cars trying to park along the north side of the street, decreasing the already tight passage on a two way street.\r\n\r\n4) Delivery trucks (the SYSCO truck, which is an 18-wheeler is a particular offender) for Romeo's frequently double park on this same narrow portion of street.\r\n\r\n5) The parking on Orange Street north of the intersection with Pearl creates a hazard for cars driving east on Pearl, trying to cross. It is impossible to see oncoming traffic, and the cars driving south on Orange cannot see cars exiting Pearl Street.\r\n\r\n6) Drivers frequently use Lincoln Street as a shortcut around the traffic that backs up from the light at Orange and Trumbull and the ensuing bottleneck from the narrowing of Orange Street between Pearl and Eld. This results in people blasting down Lincoln at speeds close to those they might reach on Whitney or some larger thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nAs I said at the opening of the post - individually, these problems would be difficult to address, together they are even more difficult.

Narrowing the travel lanes by reducing pedestrian crossing distances would be one of the most effective ways to permanently reduce speeds. The city could also consider raised intersections and roundabouts, as they have in other neighborhoods.\r\n\r\nChris Heitmann wrote:\r\n\r\nCars don\u2019t look like that when crashing at 25mph, which is what the posted speed limit is here and throughout New Haven. On neighborhood streets like Central and Willard, it arguably should be slower, more like 20mph. While the NHPD has done an excellent job of stepping up traffic enforcement in the neighborhood, enforcement will only get us so far. Similarly with education: it\u2019s needed, but will have a very limited impact (no pun intended). The third \u201cE\u201d - Engineering - is where the city can really improve safety here. As Pedro suggests, this intersection is an excellent candidate for a small roundabout (not as big as on West Park, for which there\u2019s no room here). Other alternatives would be bumping out the sidewalk at all four corners, thus narrowing the street and reducing crossing distances, raised crosswalks, and/or pedestrian refuges/planted medians leading into the intersection. The city needs to really study what the BEST solution would be here, and to consult with neighbors throughout. My concern with the idea of another traffic light is that cars would arguably speed more in order to make the light. The solution needs to SLOW PEOPLE DOWN, which would make this safer for cars, pedestrians, cyclists, and the kids who cross and wait here for the school bus every morning.\r\n\r\nThank goodness no one was seriously hurt yesterday and that no pedestrians or cyclists without 3000 pounds of steel to product them were in the intersection when this happened. A big thank you to the NHFD for a job well done and to the Independent for bringing attention to this sadly ongoing yet preventable issue.\r\n\r\nA few other residents wrote:\r\n\r\n- I live a few houses down on Willard, and that intersection is horrible. You have to pull out almost into the middle of Central to see past the street parking, and people fly up and down Central. It\u2019s the only big intersection in the area without a 4 way stop.\r\n\r\n- I was almost involved in a serious accident in high school right at this intersection. A guy in a Camaro was flying down central, and I pulled out from willard not seeing him (since he was so far down the street) and he slammed his brakes hard and just missed me.  While I was the \u201ccause\u201d of him stopping, it was the fact that he was going about 60 down central that would have caused the accident.\r\n\r\n- Central is a nice long straight run through Westville and people use it as a speedway to cross over New Haven all the time since it links Rt 34 to Whalley. The minimal cost of stop signs at all of the unsignaled intersections would greatly reduce the speeds on this street.\r\n\r\n- Thank God no one was killed last night. That is without question one of THE WORST intersections in New Haven. Speed on Central Ave combined with poor visibility from Willard is a recipe for casualties.\r\n\r\nSee http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/grand_am/\r\n", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.9608931, 41.3238723]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/67319", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/signs.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2010-12-02T11:30:25-05:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/gkfjEg", "updated_at": "2015-01-29T09:26:41-05:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/67319", "summary": "Dangerous Intersection, Crazy Crashes", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/67319/flag", "address": "Central Ave. & Willard St. New Haven, CT", "lat": 41.3238723, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9608931, "acknowledged_at": "2013-08-26T10:09:20-04:00", "reporter": {"name": "Anonymous", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 67319, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/67319/comments"}, {"status": "Open", "rating": 11, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/60274/close"}, "description": "too bad the street was just rebuilt. crossing distances are too kong for comfortable walkability of all ages.

Much of this is cut-through traffic trying to avoid the light at Fountain St.   and Forest Rd. While cut-through traffic in and of itself is arguably OK, the speeding is not. Beside the traffic noise of fast-moving cars (often 40-45 mph), there are about a dozen kids under the age of 7 just on the half-block closest to Willard - and lots more in a one-block radius - that routinely play near the street. This is a serious safety and quality of life issue. \r\n\r\nA few possible solutions to slow people down would be:\r\n1) Install two nice big asphalt speed humps (rather than speed bumps, which are shorter and can be very loud when cars pass over). Speed humps do not cost  a lot and work very well in substantially lowering speeds - it's an easy fix for the speeding and would probably also help cut down on the cut-through traffic. The only downside as far as I can tell is that snowplows and in-street bicyclists have to get used to them. See photo.\r\nOR\r\n2) Alternate street parking from one side to the other once or twice down the block, and bump-out or stripe the transitions with chicanes. The bump-outs could create some nice new planting areas, which neighbors on this block would likely and gladly take on maintenance of. Building them is relatively expensive b/c of the curbing, but they could be striped first as a cheap experiment. See photo in next post.\r\nOR\r\n3) Just allow cars to park on both sides of Barnett, creating what's called a \"queuing street\" - cars have to pull over and wait to pass one another. This latter approach is a new standard for low-volume residential streets in Portland, OR and is the defacto standard on older streets all over the world. This would be cheapest - just some new parking signs. Barnett is roughly 27' wide, just between the 26-28' wide standard for a two-sided parking queuing street. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing other possible solutions.
