I wake up to the sound of the sanitation workers. Normal pickup day for my area is Tuesday mornings. Due to the snow storm we did not have normal pickup which is Tuesday mornings. This is definitely understandable. My trash was left on the curve all week until last night.. We brought it back in because people were passing by adding garbage which was mixed with anything. Without any notice from the city we were not given a notice that trash would be collected this morning. I listen faithfully where ever there is a call from the city and confirm by pressing one. What happened to notice of pickup for today. This was not handled properly and is very upsetting. And by the way I did rush to the door to call the workers,did they stop ? No. I believe one family in the block had trash out. Come on people..
