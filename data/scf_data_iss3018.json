The speeding buses and cars take a beating, so we don't need to keep asking the police to come down here to spread our tax dollars around, eventually the buses won't be able tobreak speeding records on Concord anymore because the will fall into one of the century old expanding sink holes.  And even if we keep paying Laydon overtime to strip the roads of asphalt, we can pay them again when they come back to pave in the Summer.  That makes good financial sense...to Laydon.  I look forward to riding my horse on the dirt roads in Morris Cove, just like old times.  Bring on Laydon Industries!!!  Anyone else we can hire to boondoggle us into bankruptcy?

All the Streets need paving they are horrendous, all the sidewalks are broke and a hazardous, and all the trees are super over grown. But yet we pay one of the highest taxes in the city, and instead of fixing the cove, let's get more money from  people of morris cove, and go around and ticket them!! Makes lots of sense!!

This morning, 9:30 am, on Chapel, this car with a government license plate drove slooooowly up the left lane approaching Church. (I was directly behind.) Once the driver reached the intersection, the light turned red. Driver then decided s/he actually wanted to turn right, so veered diagonally into the right lane in front of all the cars that were waiting there. Passenger waved at them out her window. The car then proceeded to start making an illegal right turn on red, as pedestrians were crossing the street and traffic was moving along Church. Then the driver decided to stop partway, blocking both crosswalks. The photo attached was taken just as the light turned green (it took me some time to grab my camera), but shows the position this fine driver wound up in during the course of this red light. \r\n\r\nI complain often about the crap driving and disregard for rules all over the city (with, we now know, deadly consequences for pedestrians). But why should citizens follow the rules when the representatives of the city so brazenly disregard them?

I learned quickly that being a pedestrian or cyclist in New Haven comes with potential peril and consequently have adapted my behaviors to be extra cautious when crossing the street. While it is frustrating to witness multiple times on a daily basis blatant disregard for basic traffic laws by citizens, I am especially alarmed when I witness City employees (presumably) in City vehicles driving in such a way. Today at 4pm as I approached the crosswalk of Nicoll and Lawrence, a City Park and Rec light green Ford Escape approached the intersection from the southeast and quite literally blew through the intersection and made a right turn onto Nicoll. This was done while accelerating and without any consideration for the stop sign nor pedestrian safety. The vehicle entered the opposing lane of traffic as it sped down Nicoll at a speed obviously greater than the speed limit. Again, this happened as I was about to enter the crosswalk and I cannot provide a description of the driver bc the vehicle was moving just that fast. I don't want to sound like a curmudgeon, as I'm in my 30s, but having been an employee of state and federal gov't in the past, and being an overall concerned citizen for  the pedestrians in New Haven (i.e. two pedestrians were killed just LAST week), I think this issue should be brought to the attention of the Park and Rec Dept and the driver should be reminded of his/her responsibility to only not injure pedestrians, but to represent the gov't and city with a better image than he/she did.

I understand very well the trouble with providing a guarantee for the safety of the students.  Even so, a great number of students in town go to neighborhood schools and do not rely on the operation of school buses.  Why cancel school when so many people live just around the corner?  How about having the occasional late opening in order to allow for extra travel time?  This is not Chicago, Atlanta, or Los Angeles: you can walk from Westville to Wooster Square in 30 minutes.  Why on earth take these drastic measures?  School has already been cancelled for tomorrow, Friday 14---are you kidding me?  The NOAA forecast talks of sun and a high of 38.  I think more citizens should voice their dissatisfaction with this policy and I hope this post will help to start a discussion.

Driving or walking by, the foul odor can be overwhelming, and even blocks away, the fumes invade. The potential \"danger\" of these emissions is a serious concern, compounded by the  billowing black smoke recently seen billowing from the factory, as well as the company's disturbing history of air pollution.\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2019The smell would drive you crazy,\u2019 said Louis Lopez, a 44-year-old mechanic who has worked for Uretek since 1984.\u201d In December 1986, The New York Times covered a controversial employee strike at Uretek Inc. Uretek workers walked off the job due to health and safety concerns, specifically regarding the solvent dimethylformamide, or DMF, which is used at the plant. They claimed that fumes sickened half of the 66 workers at the plant. Later, testing by Yale confirmed the damage: 36 of the tested employees had ''significant liver-function abnormalities,'' and ten were diagnosed with toxic hepatitis, findings that, according to the doctor, were ''overwhelmingly'' linked to DMF*\r\n\r\nThe workers\u2019 health problems in 1986 were \u201cnot the first time that Uretek has been accused of wrongdoing,\u201d according to the Times article. In 1984, the Uretek vice president John Andrews was convicted on felony charges of illegally storing and disposing of hazardous waste \u2013 making it \u201cthe first time a corporation in Connecticut had been convicted of such a criminal offense in a trial.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe article also noted that Uretek has been cited by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on air pollution.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was many years ago, Uretek's emissions and its potential impact on the environment and people remain a very significant concern.\r\n\r\nThe DEP was notified a few years back (when the odors seemed particularly strong and noxious even blocks away). Despite Uretek\u2019s pollution history, DEP\u2019s response seemed disinterested. As far as we know, no air quality testing was conducted, nor any follow-up. \r\n\r\nA health issue as serious and dangerous as this requires more than discussions or assurances from factory management. It would seem logical and imperative that thorough air quality testing be conducted (especially after hours/at night when the odors are often strongest) and that the results be made publicly available.\r\n\r\nDoes DEP receive notification of SeeClickFix concerns? \r\n\r\n", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.8889185, 41.3000293]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/46382", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/signs.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2010-07-14T16:40:12-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/c5XGXs", "updated_at": "2014-02-11T16:29:00-05:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/46382", "summary": "Noxious fumes from Uretek factory", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/46382/flag", "address": "30 Lenox Street New Haven, CT 06513, USA", "lat": 41.3000293, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.8889185, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "Q River Community Member", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 46382, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/46382/comments"}, {"status": "Open", "rating": 8, "transitions": {"close_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/39908/close"}, "description": "Over the years I've noticed that ambulances park for very long periods on end with the motor running, spewing\r\ngas (deisel?) fumes into the downtown city air near pedestrians and city shops.
