I wake up to the sound of the sanitation workers. Normal pickup day for my area is Tuesday mornings. Due to the snow storm we did not have normal pickup which is Tuesday mornings. This is definitely understandable. My trash was left on the curve all week until last night.. We brought it back in because people were passing by adding garbage which was mixed with anything. Without any notice from the city we were not given a notice that trash would be collected this morning. I listen faithfully where ever there is a call from the city and confirm by pressing one. What happened to notice of pickup for today. This was not handled properly and is very upsetting. And by the way I did rush to the door to call the workers,did they stop ? No. I believe one family in the block had trash out. Come on people..

Avgas-fueled aircraft are the single largest source of lead air emissions in the country.  See Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2010. 

A July 2011 study from Duke University published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives supports concerns about the severe and negative public health consequences caused by lead emissions from aircraft. The report found that children living within 500 meters of an airport at which planes use leaded avgas have higher blood lead levels than other children. This effect of aircraft lead emissions on blood lead levels was also evident among children living within 1 kilometer of airports. The researchers concluded that there is a significant association between potential exposure to lead emissions from aviation gasoline and blood lead levels in children.

Results of lead monitoring conducted by EPA at 17 general aviation airports around the country were announced in June 2013, confirming the existing danger and further reinforcing the need for immediate EPA action to phase out lead in avgas.

The person who operates this vehicle is a resident on either Academy or Court and is not conducting city business during the times that the vehicle is parked in violation.  Often it is parked too close to the fire hydrant or to the entrance of Court Street making the turn onto court dangerous and difficult to navigate. 

Moreover, the vehicle is huge and is often parked nearly on top of other vehicles or blocking in other vehicles that are legally and respectfully parallel parked on the street.  There have been numerous times that we parkers have been unable to easily get our cars out of our parking space without damage due to this vehicle being parked illegally, or too close.  

It seems unfair and unjust that a person operating a city vehicle outside of their business hours is free to park anywhere they wish, in violation of many parking codes, and yet we residents are ticked regularly while simply unloading groceries or home goods for a matter of moments.

We have spoken with City Plan and City Engineering and it appears that this is a reasonable request and use for the river shores. 

We have also spoken to State Representative Roland Lemar who supports the project and believes that with interest from resident's demonstrated we can get a trail funded here. 

If you would use this area recreationally or would like to see this trail created please vote up this issue and share it with neighbors. As organizers we would like to see that there is real interest(50 or more votes might convince us :) from the community before we organize to push the issue to the State.

Could you arrange to move the bins located under the windows Housing in 116 crown street ?
These bins could move a few meters down the park, there are other bins and that would disturb anyone.
it is impossible to open the windows to ventilate the housing because odors are insuportables and flies and wasps are around garbage cans fit into the housing .
I opened two windows quickly ( as with odors, I can not open the windows more than 5 minutes) this morning to ventilate the apartment and my 4 year old daughter was stung by a wasp !
this place near the green looks like a slum , the place becomes unsafe . for 2 months , we have cockroaches and other insects.
in addition to being unsafe , dangerous and not hygienic with insect bites bins here are as dangerous as the weekend with the opening of the nightclub the "" insomnia "" , young hiding to smoke .... just a smoldering cigarette set fire to garbage cans and parked right next to cars that would cause an explosion in the windows of homes !

you will find this message with pictures ( you 'll have the chance to not have odors picture :-))

Nor have they concerned themselves much about the danger their persistently illegally parked supply trucks present to the public (driving OR walking).

Certainly, drugs exist within these zones even if such existence is illegal. Furthermore, the drugs that are illegal in Drug Free Zones, but still present, are illegal and ubiquitous everywhere else as well. Let's make these Drug Free Zones make more sense and help them achieve their eponymous goals by establishing Free Drug Zones. In these Free Drug Zones, the city, or an organization operating on its behalf, would provide a clean, safe environment to dispense otherwise illegal drugs freely or, at least, below market rates. The creation of such Free Drug Zones would alleviate some of the problems associated with the War on Drugs by obviating the violent enforcement of anti-drug laws and by putting local dealers out of business, thereby precluding them from having to resort to violence for their own protection. The loss of these businesses might harm the local economy in the short term, but I think it will help in the long run by keeping more community members out of prison.

My suggestion: We all start leaving empty Amazon delivery boxes on our doorsteps. That would make it difficult for the thieves to identify which homes have a (real) package and those that are empty. It strikes me that the thieves want to move quickly; if we're adding lots of boxes, it slows them down, and it increases the chances that one of us will see them. If enough of us do this, it may make theft unprofitable since the thieves will faced with a higher chance of being caught and a higher chance of scoring an empty box. Any other ideas welcome, but I'll be putting out boxes in the morning and on random days thereafter.

""Consider also that there are cities in the United States today that exact a higher death toll from violence than the civilian death toll in the war in Afghanistan.
Last year, some 3,000 Afghan civilians died in the Afghan War out of a population of 30 million, which makes the civilian death rate from the Afghan war 1 in 10,000.
Yet residents of New Orleans are being killed at a rate that is six times that of Afghan civilians killed in that war.New Orleans had 199 murders last year, or 6 for every 10,000 residents.
Washington, D.C., where I write this from, had 108 murders last year or 2 for every 10,000 residents, making it twice as deadly as the Afghan War is for civilians.""
So, I just did the math for here in New Haven, which was 1 murder (unsure if all were gun deaths) for every 3636 people in 2011, since we had 34 deaths, which equals almost 3 out of every 10,000 people, 3x's higher than the war! So far in 2012, we've had 28, according to a cursory web search.

Stereomedia.Org would like to challenge MakeHaven to create a design that is an improvement to this.  The terms of this assignment as as follows:

>  It might include electronics (sensors especially)
>  It should be durable to withstand the elements
>  It should be cheap to manufacture
>  It must be seen as an improvement to the original design

In the event that the design is successful, there are tons of towns and municipalities of all shapes and sizes which might be interested in trying out this type of civic improvement in their downtown sidewalks.  If the design succeeds and these organizations become interested in implementing this design, maybe it will keep #nhv on the map for cool inventions, and would be a great way to connect two great organizations (SeeClickFix and MakeHaven).

899,,"200 Orange Street New Haven, CT",Other,,2012-07-25T13:23:46-04:00,"There was one of those giant, white  city vans (Not sure which department) parked in the ""firelane"" at 200 Orange area. Behind the empty city van sat a small sedan with a woman inside it. She looked like a regular New Havener. I believe she was talking on her phone, minding her business.

At that point, a recognizable See Click Fix user (A Jane Jacobs, in fact) was walking by.  Noticing the woman in the car (and apparently not the huge city van) this SCF user turned around, made eye contact with the citizen in the sedan, and pointed to what looked to be a city sign (which probably indicated that this area is no longer used for parking like it once was).

The SCF user stood there for about 5 seconds, pointing at the sign and making eye contact. A very serious look on her face. No words were exchanged, but the meaning was clear: ""Jane Jacobs"" wanted this private citizen to MOVE ALONG, and OBEY THE RULES.
So, while I would normally just report ""Illegal parking in the firelane in front of 200 Orange/Webster Bank"", what was really bothersome was the possible altercation that could have happened between this recognizeable SCF user and a private citizen sitting in her own car on Orange Street.

Is SCF meant to carry on into the daily mindset of the community?  Are SCF reporters, in essence, ""Deputized"" by city departments to be the ears, eyes, and arms of city hall

Why was/is it acceptable to this Jane Jacobs that an 16 foot city van be parked illegally, while a tiny sedan with an actual person in it, be worthy of her firm attention.

Should we all be engaging other members of the public when we witness them doing something wrong? or should we just report it here?

I'm not sure who owns the land but keeping it empty will not make them money or help the community.  For all the time that space has been abandoned (since Bare Beans left and the flower shop burned down and who knows what's going on with Martin's) the developer could have offered free rent to small businesses and allowed them to get started and establish themselves.  They would have made the same $0 they've made over the last year, but could've helped the community.

I believe we have enough families who would go there every day if there was a small Nicas-like market, a nice restaurant on the water and some kind of outside seating where we could sit by the water and have lunch, coffee, etc.  Build a parking lot, plant some trees and put some tables outside, like Nica's.  You don't need a lot to make that a nice space- the river and marina view is enough.  

We desperately need a coffee shop that opens early in the morning, before 9am; a good small market; and a convenience store.  The entire neighborhood would shop there IF there was adequate parking and traffic signs.

PLEASE do something with that area. Not developing this property and allowing it to remain unoccupied, or occupied by unappealing businesses (sorry, Ziggy) is so detrimental to our neighborhood.

Please vote here if you want to see this problem addressed and if you agree: 

1. Every citizen has the right to freedom from fear: a safe neighborhood and a safe house.

2. No child living in New Haven or anywhere else nearby should have to hear gunshots every week in their neighborhood (I currently do!).

3. A friend recently said ""it is easier to get a gun than a quart of milk in my neighborhood."" This is obviously not an acceptable situation.

4. A comprehensive community strategy is needed to stop the violence. Elected representatives should be able to explain exactly what they are doing to support the community's strategy.

5. The constant outdoor gunfire at the police training range is not acceptable. People living in Newhallville and Beaver Hills hear constant gunfire from this range and it sends the wrong message.

Please post ideas for community organizing to stop the message, links to relevant pages, etc -- and send the message to everyone that enough is enough!

i'd like to open this issue to call attention to the businesses that do not recycle, because if we as individuals go to great lengths to recycle in our own homes, then why should we continue to support businesses that do not regardless of why they should? 

also, i believe it is shameful, as well as utterly lazy and shortsighted for the city of new haven to not have a policy in place to reprimand businesses who do not recycle. it is almost 2011 and we can't as a collective of intelligent human beings realize that, for instance, when you recycle aluminum, it does not break down over time and is 100% recyclable? one can equals one can for the rest of eternity?

despite the negative effect on my livelihood, i call for a boycott on businesses in new haven that do not recycle, until they begin. before you dine somewhere, ask if they recycle. if they do not, tell the manager that is why you refuse to spend your money there, but that you will return when they begin a recycling program.

So at the risk of being bounced off - I am going to give it a try.

I run a support and educational group for Diabetes. I myself have problems. I moved here in 2007 and was appauled at the lack of health care support here comparitively.

There was nothing for Diabetics, there is only one free clinic and that is only for that section of New Haven residents, there are no free pharmacy clinics. My shock comes from the fact that Connecticut has soooo many colleges and the biggest ""enterprise"" is Yale. Yet hardly anything is given back to the community here.  

We need more health care access to those who desperately need it. Its a shame that when I came to Connecticut I had no insurance at first but needed a perscription refill I had no other choice (exhausting all information) but to go to the ER for it. For absolutely NO SERVICES what so ever, waited three hours to spend less then 2 minutes with a doctor who wrote me a perscript based on my medical records I brought with me - cost? $541  This is absolutely absurd!  Not only the cost but the fact that I had to resort to the ER to do it. 

The other saddest thing is that I don't qualify for state aid because I have no children and am not married. All I need and want are my routine blood tests done and revaluation of my meds. I am not one who gets sick, who needs medical attention nor who runs to the ER for every scratch and booboo. I take very good care of myself, educate others on the same and live a healthy lifestyle. But I cant afford to get my blood work done to see if my medications need tweeked. 

I need your help - your voice - in chiming in to demand more free clinics, a free pharmacy and a Diabetic and Endocrine resource center. I have come up with a great plan to help with these clinics to take off the financial burdan of the state. We need the public to come forth and demand it. To push for it. To help finding solutions.

This morning, 9:30 am, on Chapel, this car with a government license plate drove slooooowly up the left lane approaching Church. (I was directly behind.) Once the driver reached the intersection, the light turned red. Driver then decided s/he actually wanted to turn right, so veered diagonally into the right lane in front of all the cars that were waiting there. Passenger waved at them out her window. The car then proceeded to start making an illegal right turn on red, as pedestrians were crossing the street and traffic was moving along Church. Then the driver decided to stop partway, blocking both crosswalks. The photo attached was taken just as the light turned green (it took me some time to grab my camera), but shows the position this fine driver wound up in during the course of this red light. 

I complain often about the crap driving and disregard for rules all over the city (with, we now know, deadly consequences for pedestrians). But why should citizens follow the rules when the representatives of the city so brazenly disregard them?

I learned quickly that being a pedestrian or cyclist in New Haven comes with potential peril and consequently have adapted my behaviors to be extra cautious when crossing the street. While it is frustrating to witness multiple times on a daily basis blatant disregard for basic traffic laws by citizens, I am especially alarmed when I witness City employees (presumably) in City vehicles driving in such a way. Today at 4pm as I approached the crosswalk of Nicoll and Lawrence, a City Park and Rec light green Ford Escape approached the intersection from the southeast and quite literally blew through the intersection and made a right turn onto Nicoll. This was done while accelerating and without any consideration for the stop sign nor pedestrian safety. The vehicle entered the opposing lane of traffic as it sped down Nicoll at a speed obviously greater than the speed limit. Again, this happened as I was about to enter the crosswalk and I cannot provide a description of the driver bc the vehicle was moving just that fast. I don't want to sound like a curmudgeon, as I'm in my 30s, but having been an employee of state and federal gov't in the past, and being an overall concerned citizen for  the pedestrians in New Haven (i.e. two pedestrians were killed just LAST week), I think this issue should be brought to the attention of the Park and Rec Dept and the driver should be reminded of his/her responsibility to only not injure pedestrians, but to represent the gov't and city with a better image than he/she did.

We are a big bowl waiting to be filled, while Tweed stays nice and dry, while our taxes go up and the ability to live here becomes so costly, so noisy or so polluted, we might as well give our homes back to the bank.

Please use the EOC system for genuine emergencies. If you need to communicate non-emergencies, please set up a non-emergency system that we can sign up for separately.

Abuse of the EOC is likely to result in people dropping EOC reception, which will impede the ability of the city to communicate during genuine emergencies.

Hi, this is Mayor Toni Harp, and I want to provide you with some important information about signing up for health insurance. 
There are free health insurance enrollment events every week in the City of New Haven where you will be able to meet one-on-one with trained and certified individuals who can answer questions and enroll you and your family in health care coverage. 
The Access Health CT open enrollment period officially closes on March 31st. After March 31st, you will be eligible to apply for health insurance through Access Health CT only if you have changes in your personal circumstances or if you qualify for Husky. 
Please visit the City of New Haven’s website at www.cityofnewhaven.com or call the New Haven Health Department at 203-946-6999 for more information, and to find the locations of these enrollment events. I encourage all residents to take advantage of this opportunity. 
Thank you.

1331,,"30 Lenox Street New Haven, CT 06513, USA",Other - city responsibility,,2010-07-14T16:40:12-04:00,"""The smell will drive you crazy...""
Uretek, a polyurethane manufacturing factory that is surrounded by residential homes and schools,  consistently produces noxious chemical smells - especially at night. Driving or walking by, the foul odor can be overwhelming, and even blocks away, the fumes invade. The potential ""danger"" of these emissions is a serious concern, compounded by the  billowing black smoke recently seen billowing from the factory, as well as the company's disturbing history of air pollution.

“’The smell would drive you crazy,’ said Louis Lopez, a 44-year-old mechanic who has worked for Uretek since 1984.” In December 1986, The New York Times covered a controversial employee strike at Uretek Inc. Uretek workers walked off the job due to health and safety concerns, specifically regarding the solvent dimethylformamide, or DMF, which is used at the plant. They claimed that fumes sickened half of the 66 workers at the plant. Later, testing by Yale confirmed the damage: 36 of the tested employees had ''significant liver-function abnormalities,'' and ten were diagnosed with toxic hepatitis, findings that, according to the doctor, were ''overwhelmingly'' linked to DMF*

The workers’ health problems in 1986 were “not the first time that Uretek has been accused of wrongdoing,” according to the Times article. In 1984, the Uretek vice president John Andrews was convicted on felony charges of illegally storing and disposing of hazardous waste – making it “the first time a corporation in Connecticut had been convicted of such a criminal offense in a trial.”

The article also noted that Uretek has been cited by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection on air pollution.

Although this was many years ago, Uretek's emissions and its potential impact on the environment and people remain a very significant concern.

The DEP was notified a few years back (when the odors seemed particularly strong and noxious even blocks away). Despite Uretek’s pollution history, DEP’s response seemed disinterested. As far as we know, no air quality testing was conducted, nor any follow-up. 

A health issue as serious and dangerous as this requires more than discussions or assurances from factory management. It would seem logical and imperative that thorough air quality testing be conducted (especially after hours/at night when the odors are often strongest) and that the results be made publicly available.

Does DEP receive notification of SeeClickFix concerns?

There was evidence of this in the spring as well. However, most recently I was there Friday morning September 12th, and there were cardboard pallets, clothes, a massive pile of very used toilet paper (yuck!) and a lot of trash. The park bench seems to be the epicenter, but it is clearly someone's favorite spot at night. 

I don't know if this venue is the appropriate one to advise people, but I figured you could alert the city or the University about the issue. It's not a nice sight for people visiting the city or the Cemetery to see as they walk there.   Thank you.

The trauma and bites to my own dog were of no consequence.  The very next day, the man was in the park with his pit bulls off-leash.  He was apparently undeterred by the fine.  We took pictures and sent them to the police officers.  We have heard from witnesses that these dogs are being bred without a license.  We have also heard that they attacked two other dogs.

NEW HAVEN >> Police uncovered drugs and cash during a raid on a city home Wednesday night at the conclusion of a two month long investigation into a methamphetamine dealing operation in Greater New Haven.
Detectives from the Statewide Narcotics Task Force’s South Central Field Office arrested two men after serving a warrant at 9 North Bank St., according to a press release from state police spokesman Lt. J. Paul Vance.
Ernest Canteen, 42, and Michael Lotto (home owner), 51, were both charged with possession of narcotics with the intent to sell, possession of narcotics, possession of narcotics within 1,500 feet of a school zone, possession of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with the intent to sell, possession of GHB, possession of GHB with the intent to sell and drug factory charges.
Vance said the detectives found 74.6 grams of meth, 250 bags of heroin, 2.2 grams of marijuana, 27.5 ounces of liquid GHB, seven hydrocodone pills, seven Clonazepam pills, 11 Vicodin pills, drug factory paraphernalia and $2,828 in cash.
The investigation focused on drug activity in Hamden and Branford, Vance said.
Canteen and Lotto were held in lieu of bail and were scheduled to appear in Superior Court in New Haven on Thursday.
Both are now out on bail and it appears to be business as usual.

This has been a problematic house for over 4 years. 
Alderman Eikler was called last summer on this and never reacted.

The owner Mike Lotto who lives in the home has been there for quite some time and has had many legal battles with the City of New Haven over building and zoning, it is still ongoing.

Even though it is zoned as a single family residence his ” tenets” have caused issues on the Street before and  the police are aware of it being problematic. The police have been at the house on many occasions.

There is a Block Watch committee but have no idea who they are or was aware of it. In fact the people in charge supposedly live on the same street next door in 11 North Bank Street.

What can we do as citizens to 
legally protect ourselves?
No one should have to live at 
risk or in fear at anytime.

I wish that the police were trained to give a more detailed and specific explanation of the law, and not perpetuated inaccuracies that favor drivers and lead to drivers in turn misunderstanding the law (I've had drivers also yelling at me for crossing on a green).

1685,,"White Trail New Haven, CT 06511, USA",Policing Issue,,2013-10-22T15:04:11-04:00,"Dear City of New Haven,
A WCHS Soccer Player was attacked on the Mill River Trail that connects Orange St. to Rice Field while walking to his soccer game last Tuesday 10/16. Many students and parents are fearful that the city/school policy of requiring students to traverse this dangerously isolated trail in order to participate in their school sports events could end in more tragedy. Some scared girls would rather risk getting hit by a car by walking on curvy English Drive just to avoid the trail. The school offers no transportation or protection to & from the daily practices and home games for both the girls and boys sports teams that have to use Rice Field. I physically checked again yesterday and the students are still completely unmonitored and unescorted. Some travel in groups and some arrive from other schools to play and still have walk alone and unprotected.

Our thinking is that short of an escort or some form of official transportation, the students remain exposed to the myriad dangers that this path to Rice Field presents. At minimum, the route should be monitored by either a school guard/official or a NHPD bicycle patrol during the time frame in which it is necessary for our students to travel it.* This seems a small concession given the area's troubled history and the fact that these are adolescents including females, some as young as fourteen years old, that are expected to navigate this deceptively dangerous and isolated place.

Future incidents are completely preventable. We're sure there are other ideas on how to stop this from ever happening again and we're interested in hearing them...one question we have is why is Cross unable or unwilling to schedule sharing their on-site football field and/or complex with soccer teams like most other High Schools?

Again, your attention to the matter is very, very much appreciated. Please keep us informed of any developments here.

*Cross generally gets out at 2:00 and students start walking from the school, down Orange St. to Rice Field at about 2:15 for daily practice or pre home game warm ups (games start at 3:45 and end at about 6 when some students walk back on the trail)

Reckless noisy clowns on Quads/ ATVs and dirt bikes (along with snowmobiles in the winter) have been plauging East Shore, & all over New Haven for years blasting up and down Townsend Ave. & side streets & noisily tearing up Black Rock Fort, park land & across lawns etc. 

They dangerously disobey traffic laws, running stop signs & traffic signals, zigzagging across the centerline towards oncoming traffic, cutting off cars etc.

As posted in original post, most recent dirtbike sighting was lastnight traveling down Townsend by Nathan Hale School and then back again headed towards the highway. Couldn't make out bike color in dark but rider was hefty WM with crewcut.
For what it's worth, word is one of the local East Shore riders might be the person who posts New Haven ""bikelife"" & girl-streetfight videos on YouTube like this of his taken on Ferry Street:

But if my grandma were biking in NH, she might feel threatened by them, and that is what concerns me. NH cyclists should feel safe and secure from cars but also fellow cyclists.

I'm bringing this exhausted topic up since I saw a woman hit (lightly bump into) a young boy on Main Street Anx (East Haven/New Haven line) sidewalk yesterday.  She was so engrossed in conversation that she didn't bother to stop, merely paused for a second before continuing down the road.  The child appeared to be shaken up but okay, so I followed her for the next few blocks.  She again went too close to the sidewalk and nearly missed hitting an elderly woman on a motorized wheelchair near Tolli's.

The fact that she wasn't phased by this incident shows that stricter laws need to be enforced, since people are too uncaring, stupid, or arrogant to be responsible for themselves.
Far too many people are endangering others daily by disregarding this law.  I can't care how skilled of a driver you feel you are, pull over to use your phone.

1820,,"1 Union Avenue New Haven, CT 06519, USA",Policing Issue,,2010-04-20T20:22:35-04:00,"We have been experiencing an exceedingly great number of quality of life issues and crime around 1 Union Ave and we would very much like the New Haven Police Department to be fix the issues before the summer months arrive. We noticed the police department continues to bill the tax payers, yet are not providing even the very basic services that a police department is expected to provide. Crime is out of control; people are constantly shooting people and being shot, violence in general is beyond scary, and all other gang crime and drug crimes are becoming far too common and committed in the open. Traffic violations are out of control; there are speeding cars everywhere, basic traffic rules are disregarded by almost everyone, and people committing more serious offenses like running red lights and stops signs occur at a frequency that is beyond appalling. Quality of life issues are out of control; the list is so long and everyone knows it. 

Why don't you start by pulling people over for basic offenses like: no brake lights, headlights out, cracked windshields, missing plates, expired plates, tinted windows, loud mufflers, and loud music. If they have tinted windows, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they have a loud muffler, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they are playing loud music, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. I guarantee the results of following these very basic procedures will be noticed by ALL the City of New Haven residents and its out of town visitors. The people who value life and want a decent quality of life will be very appreciative. 

You say you cannot because you are undermanned/understaffed. Not true. You need to restructure your department. It is as simple as that. You also need to get your priorities straight. Why do we see countless officers all over town watching construction workers doing their jobs? Or, directing traffic like a flagman, at best? You say safety. Not true. Why not hire a real flagger who has been trained? Half the time these officers are sitting in their cars talking on their cell phones. Lately, we have seen not one cop at each construction site, but two, usually sitting around talking and not paying attention. All of these officers could, and SHOULD, be driving around pulling people over for the above mentioned quality of life and traffic offenses. Simple as that. Again, if they have tinted windows, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they have a loud muffler, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. If they are playing loud music, pull them over. If they then look suspicious, search the vehicle. The procedure is simple and effective and has years of use behind it to back up its effectiveness. 

If you follow this simple plan that I have spelled out above (it doesn't require much brain matter), it is certain that this little town of 124,000 people can return to some degree of normalcy before the summer really gets going. I am sure there are many other New Haven residents out there that would agree with me.

2183,,"93 Pearl St New Haven, Connecticut",Potholes,,2014-11-04T11:18:50-05:00,"Several weeks ago, the Southern CT Gas company conducted infrastructure works in the entire neighborhood (Pearl, Pleasant, Clark, Lincoln).  The work caused major inconvenience, from noise to a city ban on street parking, but as residents, we understood the need to be patient and the potential long-term benefits of having solid infrastructure. However, when it was time to seal the holes in the road, the construction crew did shoddy work. As a result, the road is uneven, full of poorly filled potholes, cracks and bumps. A simple slow drive to get out of the street has become a difficult and bumpy experience. Like most of my neighbors, I own a simple sedan, not an all terrain vehicle that can handle such a ride. And with small children in the back of my car, the ride has become particularly unsafe. Since Pearl St and many of its adjacent roads  - which were also badly damaged during the construction project- are one-way streets, it is practically impossible to get out of the street and into one of the main roads (e.g. State st, Orange st) without saying a prayer first. I have lived here for 3 years now, and know that the city usually repairs the roads once a year, after the winter has caused its usual damages. I also know that budget is tight. However, I can’t imagine living like this through the rest of the fall and the entire winter.

 There is a long pothole on State Street, just north of Crown Street, where a sewer separation job has turned into a trough.  On that part of State Street many large trucks come barrelling down to try to make the light at George Street and when they hit the trough it makes the buildings near that corner shake.  It also happens when trucks and cars turn that corner from State onto Crown too fast.

Could we get his manhole cover fixed again, and include a gasket? The manhole cover noise was reduced when Doug was alder, but the fix didn't last, perhaps because part of the fix 
was to put pavement over the cover, rather than to reseat with a gasket or shims.

Clark St has a similar problem -- who else has loud manhole covers?

2893,,"88 High Street New Haven, Connecticut","Public Space, Streets and Drains",,2014-07-16T15:47:23-04:00,"Issue : Yale has repeatedly failed to meet its legal obligation to promptly repair roads following construction, most notably on High Street which for the past decade has resembled the siege of Vicksburg.
New Haven Code of Ordinances (Article III, Ch.27, Sec27-71 through 27-84)  is clear that street excavations have to be patched to the specs for the street and the repairs cannot fail for at least several years.

Issue : Yale has (most probably without permission) taken it upon themselves to paint a crosswalk midblock on High Street (btwn Chapel and Elm) with the daily net effect of an elderly person standing in the middle of the street focusing his or her camera on Harkness tower, unaware of impending vehicles.
CT State Statutes (Section 14-297) define a crosswalk as the extension of a public sidewalk across a street to another sidewalk. The path from Old Campus Quad to Harkness Tower fails to meet that definition.. Although the BOA was foolish enough to sell the rest of High Street, this portion still remains public property and should not be commandeered by the University.

Issue: Yale has also taken it upon themselves to tamp a large pile of asphalt on the Harkness side of the street sloping from street to sidewalk. Although this resembled a handicap ramp, it fails to actually meet the ADA definition, is the inversion of a curb cut extending out into the street and therefore puts vehicles in grave danger. A peninsula of curb height pavement extending several feet out into a city street (already constricted by Yale’s dorm renovations) recklessly endangers the public.
High Street is public property and should not be used or abused by private entities.

the following things have happened to me in the past week (to help paint a picture of how many happen overall):

i was cursed out in the crosswalk in front of the police station for daring to cross legally, because i'm a ""b*tch"" who thinks i can ""walk wherever i want""

i flipped over my handlebars after nearly being missed by a car running a red light, and then was nearly missed by the car speeding behind me. neither of the vehicles stopped to see if i was ok.

i was cursed at for riding in line with sharrows on state street because i should ""get out of the way"" and ""stay on the #$%&# sidewalk""

a man and i, while crossing in a crosswalk, were violently honked at, despite crossing legally, and the fact that he was using a cane. when i challenged the driver honking, a stream of curse words came, and the driver behind him screamed ""WELCOME TO NEW HAVEN, WE DON'T GIVE A @#$%""

while waiting at a red light going straight towards the train station, with my bike physically stopped ON A SHARROW, a man got out of his BMW to ask me why i wasn't all the way over to the right (even though that is a turn lane and i wasn't turning) and when i explained why, he started screaming that i'm ""supposed to let all the cars pass"" since i was ""blocking all the traffic"" (while stopped at a light legally, and after keeping up with the flow of traffic for my entire trip) (and, ""let all the cars pass""? so i should wait at each intersection until not one car exists?)

with this level of aggression, it is a wonder we walk or bike at all.

• “‘Blighted’ shall mean deteriorating, in a state of ill repair, filthy or decaying….”
• “’Dilapidated’ shall mean a building or structure or part thereof that would not receive a certificate of occupancy if it were applied for…""
• Examples of both at 86 Second Street include 
•	Rotted cornice molding at front-left and rear-left corners of roof, holes in said cornice covered with scraps of metal but allowing entrance of birds and squirrels; 
•	Rotted molding of overhang, between exterior 1st floor and 2nd floor. Over front exterior entrance to 2nd floor, ends of said molding merely were filled with expanding foam, still allowing entrance of birds, squirrels, insects and water—but  not repaired; 
•	rotted, split eave boards under 2nd floor front windows (of said overhang between 1st and 2nd floor) 
•	Aforementioned split eave boards contain a massive wasp nest, such that tenants on 2nd floor cannot open front windows in summer; 
•	Rotted, split eave of this same overhang “repaired” with expanding foam: where it terminates on right side/Greenwich Ave. side of building
•	Rotted top-trim [lintel boards] over BOTH small windows on left, 1st floor side of building
•	new plywood eave that was added to left side of building [after original collapsed, along with much of the roof,  into neighbor’s driveway] was NOT completed at front corner: it does not meet properly with the eave return
•	this entire new eave—illegally installed by unlicensed contractor—was   attached with drywall screws rather than exterior-grade fasteners—and therefore is likely to collapse again soon; it also has not been painted or covered with siding to protect this new eave from weather damage; 
•	this same new plywood eave and facia on left side of building already is water-stained at joints due to water infiltration: likely caused both by lack of gutter maintenance as well as incompetently installed new roof
•	gutters not maintained: overflow when raining, because they never have been cleaned. As noted above, this also is damaging eave and facia
•	Rotted eave returns on the front of building were “repaired” in slap-dash manner by unlicensed—i.e. illegal—contractor ; they were not “continued” properly where they meet the side eaves; and both “returns” are about to collapse due to contractor’s incompetence: they are barely secured to the building! This is an IMMEDIATE  hazard to pedestrians and tenants
•	“building contains unauthorized storage or accumulation of junk, trash, rubbish, litter or refuse”: behind and in front of the garages
•	The rotted door at top of rear, exterior stairway is an INterior-grade lauan door—not rated for exterior use. This creates an immediate security problem for tenants—and is a fire hazard.
•	many exterior clapboards are split, shedding paint [lead paint?] everywhere and allowing water infiltration; the most-heavily damaged clapboards are on left side of building; this is causing structural damage/rot to building’s sill and framing and is adding to persistent mold problem inside apartments; inspector needs to examine sill from inside basement. ***HOUSING COURT and LCI should NOT resolve tenant’s mold and dampness complaint [see below] until this is resolved. *** Otherwise mold remediation in apartment only will be very temporary.
•	mold and algae are on window sills at building’s left side—due  to malfunctioning gutters and general lack of maintenance 
•	birds are nesting inside furnace air-intake vents on left side of building, due to lack of  guards here to keep out birds/rodents; this is a carbon monoxide hazard!
•	Plywood siding is rotted under concrete roof edge at REAR of brick/cinderblock addition (between garage and wood frame part of building): i.e. along rear, exterior wood stairway
•	huge pile of dry leaves under rear, exterior wood stairway—creating immediate fire hazard
•	rotted trim where wood of building abuts concrete sidewalk, at the angled, corner doorway of 1st floor unit numbered “371” [Greenwich] 
•	“It is a fire hazard as determined by the fire marshal, or as documented in fire department reports.” About 10 days ago members of the New Haven Fire Dept. spent considerable time photographing the exterior of this building. I suspect they have a report which LCI can access.
Owner Kirsten Hopes-McFadden (and “agent”/spouse Tillman “Tim” McFadden) of North Haven were ordered by LCI to fix numerous problems with 2nd floor apartment of 86 Second ST. back in Oct, 2013; they were re-ordered in Feb, 2014—and finally had to be taken to Housing Court this month by the tenant to commence repairs. 
***WHY DID LCI allow the problem to drag out so long that the tenant had no recourse but to bypass LCI—and go to Housing Court for repairs to commence??***
“blighted lots and buildings adversely affect the city's economic well-being, and are inimical to the health, safety and welfare of the city's residents…It is found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain structures and properties have the further effect of creating blighted conditions and initiating slums, and that if the same are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the expenditures of large amounts of public funds [i.e. taxpayers money!] to correct and eliminate the same.” (from Anti-blight and property maintenance ordinance; . Declaration of Policy*)
It is part of LCI’s responsibilities to ENFORCE the Anti-blight ordinance. It is my hope that neighbors will not need to turn to the courts—as the tenant did—in order to get LCI to carry out its responsibilities as they relate to 86 Second Street. 
ADDITIONALLY, due to owner’s persistent history of hiring incompetent, unlicensed, illegal contractors to perform hazardous, makeshift repairs, LCI needs to INSIST that above-mentioned problems be repaired by a state-licensed, insured contractor—as is required by CT state law. And LCI should insist on PROOF of said licensure and insurance by the contractor. It is ILLEGAL in the state of CT for contractors to be working without licensure: http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?q=274440 Note that Building officials are prohibited from issuing building permits unless they receive a copy of the contractor’s valid Certificate of Registration http://www.ct.gov/dcp/cwp/view.asp?a=4308&q=507962

The building sits dark and quiet most of the year, though they seem to run a business renting parking across from the Yale School of Nursing, and to hold the occasional fraternal event inside.

A few points:

- The sidewalk out front is always strewn with trash, which accumulate in an unkept strip of grass.  

- They do not keep up with foliage on their property which over-grow to the sidewalk (at the moment, the sidewalk is entirely impassable due to a bush growing through their fence.)  

- They are always slow to clean the snow from the walk, and when they do, they clear the gravel from their parking lot into the street, and in a pile on the sidewalk across the street.  

- At the times they do hold an event, the police who attend park on the sidewalks, double-park, and generally act recklessly with their vehicles.

I am not sure who to direct this to, but for anyone representing the city, please see that the Club is made aware of these offences and that they are made to accord to all the standards of those they share the neighborhood with (maybe don't use Yale Nursing as an example, though.)",673169.0,1251,41.2998145661,-72.9327211227,0.0,Anonymous,Registered User,http://bit.ly/14wBqMJ,Acknowledged,Marchigian Club,2014-01-08T13:28:30-05:00,1251,Hill

Reference:  Side Walk & Driveway

Greetings;

In April of 2012 I purchased a home at 339-341 W. Division Street in New Haven.  I love my home but getting in and out of my Driveway is a major job.  The first thing is that the Driveway is very narrow and the second issue; is that my neighbors across the street who has a much wider Driveway, has five to six cars which parks along one side of the street even blocking their own Driveway.  This makes it very hard for me and my family to pull in, pull out, back in and back out if my Driveway on a regular bases. I can’t even pull out of my Driveway if they have their driver side car doors open.  I have to wait on them which happen a lot.   West Division Street is already a one way street and a bit of a tight street. I’m seeking your help, assistance and/or advice in this matter.

Now, last but not least I purchase the corner lot property which is W. Division Street and Sherman Pkwy.  I’m suggesting and seeking to move my Driveway on the side of my property to avoid the whole issue with my neighbors and the inconvenience of the whole matter.  This will also allow me to enter and exit my property on a two way street a well.  

There is no sidewalk on the Sherman Pkwy.  I was under the impression that a Sidewalk was going to be placed a while ago after speaking with Neighborhood Housing Services.  Also, seeing how the fence went down and the trees came up across the street on Sherman Pkwy, I assumed it would be part of the beautification process.  I could be mistaken and if so I’m seeking your help in trying to get a side walk placed on the side of my property which has a high traffic rate/usage.   Children take the rout every day for the school bus and going to and from school each day along residents and not to forget that when the parking runs out at James Hillhouse High School for the various events that is hosted the area in questioned is used quite a bit.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could get back to me as soon as possible on his matter.  Please feel free to contact me on the number listed above.  I thank you in advance for all of your help, understanding and cooperation.

What happens is that cars turning left on Grand sit clogging up Quinnipiac because traffic is backed up on Grand waiting for the bridge. The halts all northbound traffic regardless if you are turning or not onto Grand. If you just want to continue Northbound you are forced into opposing traffic to pass cars trying to turn left. Going south there is usually enough space to get by cars trying to turn right onto Grand. Northbound there is no room to get around left turning traffic.

I feel that this issue should remain open until a route that all persons -- age 8 to 80 -- feel comfortable riding their bikes on.  Although sharrows are a minor improvement over nothing, adding sharrows to the road simply does not do that.

65 people previously voted on this issue: ""Bike lane needed from Clinton Avenue to Orange Street,"" but that issue is being closed because sharrows have been installed. http://www.seeclickfix.com/issues/8658-bike-lane-needed-from-clinton-avenue-to-orange-street

Sharrows are ineffective at increasing cycling rates unless speeds are reduced to 20MPH. 

Portland, OR, and New York City, NY, are currently doing this along hundreds of miles of their residential streets.

Studies show that very few people will feel comfortable bicycling on roads unless speeds are strictly capped at 20MPH -- no matter what kind of paint you have on the road. 

Achieving these average speeds along bike routes can be done through various traffic calming and traffic engineering methods. Berkeley has pioneered this decades ago this with its ""bicycle boulevards,"" and many cities have since followed.
It is best to call them ""slow streets"", since they have a tremendous benefit for pedestrians and property owners as well.

The sharrows here should be replaced with street engineering that meets the standards of the NACTO -- whether bike lanes, buffered bike lanes, traffic calmed boulevards, or some other feature: http://nacto.org/cities-for-cycling/design-guide/ .

When I last tried this in the fall on a Saturday, the Farmington Canal just sort of ends (is more construction bringing the canal forward?) somewhere near Yale University buildings with no indication of how to get from this (to me) unfamiliar part of the city to where I work (I normally go on the highway), or any information about bicycle routes in the city. 

So my suggestion is that at the end of the trail (if this bridge area marks the end of the trail) some sort of signage be placed to indicate where you are and how to get to other parts of the city. 

Also, is there any sort of resource listing existing on-street bike bike paths and bike-separated bike lanes in the area? 

In other words, once you're in New Haven on a bike, where you can go that's bike friendly? I've heard about shoreline routes under construction, but have no idea how to get there. 

Any advice is welcome.

The Orange street bike lane north and southbound from Trumbull St. to Willow St. is a death trap. I made the mistake of trying to commute to work on bike and had to swerve potholes and debris the entire time while worrying about traffic, buses, and poorly parked cars. This was the most unsafe ride I have ever had, anywhere - and this was supposed to be the major north/south biking artery of East Rock. 

At one point, I had to try and jump a pothole and my rear tire didn't make it causing a flat tire and slightly bent rim. I am mad about my expensive commuter bike, but honestly, mostly just relieved I didn't tumble into traffic or hit my face. Some of these pot holes are more than 6 inches deep. A pothole for a car is an inconvenience with the possibility of tire/rim damage; a pothole on a bike however is a major safety concern- people have been killed like that.

All roads in East Rock are in horrible shape coming out of a long winter, understandably it will take some time to address this issue everywhere. But please, please, fix the bike lanes first. 

If you are looking to commute on bike, strongly consider taking a bus or walking until roads are improved. New Haven City officials, please try riding a bike in one of these bike lanes and reporting back.

I am not questioning the need for crossing guards and have no issues with them stopping traffic as pedestrians are crossing. But I do question the need for crossing guards to direct traffic when no pedestrians are present.

This past Monday, March 2 I was traveling down Edgewood and witnessed a crossing guard stop traffic on Edgewood to allow a school bus and several other vehicles cross through Edgewood. The crossing guard actually ended up totally blocking traffic because there was not adequate space for vehicles to move across Edgewood.

I would suggest that the City of New Haven implement several measures to alleviate this problem:

1) Do not allow delivery trucks to drop off during rush hour periods

2) On streets with heavy rush-hour traffic volume, implement a no parking ban at street meters (7-9am / 4-6pm). This is something that other cities do with much success.

5401,,"47 Court Street New Haven, Connecticut",Traffic/Road Safety,,2015-02-18T14:58:22-05:00,"Something must be done to slow traffic on Olive Street. Unhampered by any stop signs or lights, cars zip down the street, often ignoring posted pedestrian crosswalks. Dolores Dogolo was struck and killed in October trying to cross the street; it’s now February, and nothing has been done to slow traffic or to secure additional, well-marked crosswalks. Compounding the problem now is the total lack of snow removal from sidewalk curbs; people still need to cross the street, regardless of weather. In order to do that now, we have to climb over snow or take a dangerous, circuitous path. We need new stop signs at the intersection of Court and Olive Streets.

At the neighborhood meeting last night, many of us discussed how we could slow traffic and ensure the safety of our pedestrians. A worker from the city claimed that a raised crosswalk would be too expensive; the crosswalk at Whitney and Audubon, for instance, cost $300,000. So: two new stop signs should be installed, replacing the “YIELD TO PEDESTRIANS” signs that are currently there and that are currently ignored. The crosswalk-sign that stays in the middle of the crosswalk until it is hit and destroyed by a car should be installed properly.

In addition, there should be crosswalks painted on all sides of the intersection; as is, only the northern crossing is painted. The sidewalks need to be prepared with proper ramps for wheelchairs and baby strollers.

This is not a cost-prohibitive project, but it is a mandatory one that must be done as soon as possible. Unfortunately for our community and for the Dogolo family, it is not proactive enough; stop signs and crosswalks should have been installed and painted long before October.

Thanks.

I was in traffic and could not take a picture, but it is highly likely that this car will require a serious repair or potential brake failure  on top of the fine and towing fee.

My car was towed several weeks ago, with the parking brake also potentially engaged, and I am now going to have to make sure that the car has not been damaged.

While towing for safety reasons make make such action necessary, I believe it is highly improper for the city to tow cars due to street sweeping if doing so will result in such severe damage.

Suggestions to reduce speeding: 

1) Speed Limit Signs Needed on Willow St. : Currently, there is a noticeable absence of speed limit signs, and none are posted on the east or west bound sides of Willow St. from the stretch from the I-91 exit ramp until after Orange St.  

2) Addition of Stop Signs at Willow/Nicoll St. Intersection: This busy intersection has been a magnet for car and pedestrian accidents for years, and the addition of east and west bound stop signs at the Willow/Nicoll St. intersection could be a quick and inexpensive effort to slow traffic, reduce speeding and hopefully mitigate future accidents.

5602,,"108-138 Pearl Street New Haven, Connecticut",Traffic/Road Safety,,2014-02-08T14:37:02-05:00,"There are so many problems with the west end of Pearl St (between Orange and the SOM walkway). Here are just a few. To resolve this issue, Yale, the Lincoln-Bradley Neighborhood association, the City of New Haven, and the landlords at 516-518 Orange and the building housing Cafe Romeo are going to need to work together. The LBNA has, in good faith, spent some time coming up with proposals for Pearl Street, none of which have stuck. I had hoped that when Yale was working to complete Evans Hall (new SOM building) they would have paid some attention to this wasp's nest of issues....but they didn't. 

1) the pathway from the back of Evans Hall empties directly into the middle of a city street with NO signage or indicators that pedestrians are now walking on a street. There should be bollards, a large sign and some kind of curb with a curb cut indicating that PEOPLE ARE WALKING IN THE MIDDLE OF A STREET. As it is now, there is a steady stream of students pouring onto Pearl St, oblivious to their surroundings talking on their phones etc. YALE - please pay attention!!!!!! You spent over a hundred million dollars on this building and it would be a shame to have one of your students injured or killed here. Also, THERE IS NO SIDEWALK ON THIS STRETCH OF PEARL STREET.

2) 516-518 Orange Street continues to be a mess.

a) their dumpsters overflow and are frequently end up in the middle of the sidewalk - they have tried to improve this situation, but it is still far from being a good situation.

b) the portion on the (too narrow) sidewalk on Pearl Street that they are responsible for cleaning is a sheet of ice. Even on the best days, this sidewalk is dangerous. The concrete is cracked and the strip of dirt between the sidewalk and the curb is usually full of broken glass and garbage that hasnt been picked up by the trash company

3) the parking area on Pearl Street adjacent to Cafe Romeo's storage locker is overcrowded and usually has one or two extra cars trying to park along the north side of the street, decreasing the already tight passage on a two way street.

4) Delivery trucks (the SYSCO truck, which is an 18-wheeler is a particular offender) for Romeo's frequently double park on this same narrow portion of street.

5) The parking on Orange Street north of the intersection with Pearl creates a hazard for cars driving east on Pearl, trying to cross. It is impossible to see oncoming traffic, and the cars driving south on Orange cannot see cars exiting Pearl Street.

6) Drivers frequently use Lincoln Street as a shortcut around the traffic that backs up from the light at Orange and Trumbull and the ensuing bottleneck from the narrowing of Orange Street between Pearl and Eld. This results in people blasting down Lincoln at speeds close to those they might reach on Whitney or some larger thoroughfare.

As I said at the opening of the post - individually, these problems would be difficult to address, together they are even more difficult. But the situation is somewhat dire, and we need to start coming up with solutions.

First I was going north on Quin near Warwick and a utility vehicle was completely blocking the lane. I could not see around the corner to know if it was safe to go around. There was a police car there but no one directing traffic. Luckily no one was coming.

I also noticed two tractor trailer like vehicles totally blocking south bound Fulton, so when coming back I decided to go around on Ferry St and Farren. I waited to take a left at a red light for 3-4 minutes, cars were passing and honking at me to turn so I finally did - on a red which was scary!

What the heck is going on here!? I don't want to risk my life with lack of traffic safety by the city.

5608,,"State Street (From Union Station To Bradley Street) New Haven, Connecticut",Traffic/Road Safety,,2014-02-04T23:52:18-05:00,"My bike commute from Upper State to the train station is a bit rough in the morning. 

It's pretty nerve-wracking to ride next to cars that are exiting/entering I-91. I'm worried that without being as defensive a rider as possible, I'm continually at risk.

I would love to see a separated bike lane down this street easily connecting East Rock to Union Station. I know it's difficult because state DOT is a pain in the butt on these issues, but it would mean so much to me!! 

I think it would also add the following (please excuse the 'rant' format!):
1) It would make less 'gung-ho' riders more open to ride this route and not drive long distances where a train were an option.
2) There's plenty of physical land with the median to maintain 4 lanes of traffic, plus add two full bike lanes. 
3) Consolidating bike lanes together on the downtown side has the capability of creating a hospitable plaza area and thus make the businesses on that side of state more attractive to customers (plus more active street life = better place to bike/live/be).
4) I feel like the land on the train tracks side has so much more potential than surface parking.

I will try to add some images of what I'm thinking later.

Bottom line:
How do I set this project in motion? Thanks!!",926527.0,2625,41.3040863389,-72.9231724586,57859.0,Davey,Registered User,http://bit.ly/1bsR7Ws,Open,Bike Lane for State Street Please?,2014-02-11T13:59:26-05:00,2625,Downtown

The signaled pedestrian phase is helpful but many problems at the intersection remain. Problems include:

A. Frequent pedestrian crossing against signal into fast-moving traffic
B. Illegal right turns against the light from Sachem to Whitney, endangering pedestrians
C. Inadequate bike parking (<10 spots); bikes are affixed to street signs and sometimes interfere with vehicle lanes on Whitney.
D. Pedestrian/bike conflicts; new bike path to Pearl St requires riders to use sidewalk for ~30ft stretch, most do not dismount. 
E. Elementary school groups visiting Peabody often crowd the northwest corner and endanger children, especially when school buses are parked on Sachem.

This problem extends the existing pedestrian/car conflicts south of Trumbull (e.g. 55 Whitney). Traffic calming seems to be increasingly importantly along this stretch.

Whitney is narrow and fast at that intersection, so bump-outs are not feasible. Solutions could include:
A. Better defined pedestrian crosswalks (like Chapel/York)
B. Traffic calming measures north of intersection, like ""Reduce Speed Ahead"" signage
C. Enforcement of no-right-turn-on-red rules
D. Increased bike parking at School of Management
E. Segregate bike path from footpath
F. Require alternative parking for school groups at Peabody, possibly in the Humphrey lot.

While the NHPD has done an excellent job of stepping up traffic enforcement in the neighborhood, enforcement will only get us so far. Similarly with education: it’s needed, but will have a very limited impact (no pun intended). The third “E” - Engineering - is where the city can really improve safety here. As Pedro suggests, this intersection is an excellent candidate for a small roundabout (not as big as on West Park, for which there’s no room here). Other alternatives would be bumping out the sidewalk at all four corners, thus narrowing the street and reducing crossing distances, raised crosswalks, and/or pedestrian refuges/planted medians leading into the intersection. The city needs to really study what the BEST solution would be here, and to consult with neighbors throughout. My concern with the idea of another traffic light is that cars would arguably speed more in order to make the light. The solution needs to SLOW PEOPLE DOWN, which would make this safer for cars, pedestrians, cyclists, and the kids who cross and wait here for the school bus every morning.

Thank goodness no one was seriously hurt yesterday and that no pedestrians or cyclists without 3000 pounds of steel to product them were in the intersection when this happened. A big thank you to the NHFD for a job well done and to the Independent for bringing attention to this sadly ongoing yet preventable issue.

A few other residents wrote:

- I live a few houses down on Willard, and that intersection is horrible. You have to pull out almost into the middle of Central to see past the street parking, and people fly up and down Central. It’s the only big intersection in the area without a 4 way stop.

- I was almost involved in a serious accident in high school right at this intersection. A guy in a Camaro was flying down central, and I pulled out from willard not seeing him (since he was so far down the street) and he slammed his brakes hard and just missed me.  While I was the “cause” of him stopping, it was the fact that he was going about 60 down central that would have caused the accident.

- Central is a nice long straight run through Westville and people use it as a speedway to cross over New Haven all the time since it links Rt 34 to Whalley. The minimal cost of stop signs at all of the unsignaled intersections would greatly reduce the speeds on this street.

- Thank God no one was killed last night. That is without question one of THE WORST intersections in New Haven. Speed on Central Ave combined with poor visibility from Willard is a recipe for casualties.

Much of this is cut-through traffic trying to avoid the light at Fountain St.   and Forest Rd. While cut-through traffic in and of itself is arguably OK, the speeding is not. Beside the traffic noise of fast-moving cars (often 40-45 mph), there are about a dozen kids under the age of 7 just on the half-block closest to Willard - and lots more in a one-block radius - that routinely play near the street. This is a serious safety and quality of life issue. 

A few possible solutions to slow people down would be:
1) Install two nice big asphalt speed humps (rather than speed bumps, which are shorter and can be very loud when cars pass over). Speed humps do not cost  a lot and work very well in substantially lowering speeds - it's an easy fix for the speeding and would probably also help cut down on the cut-through traffic. The only downside as far as I can tell is that snowplows and in-street bicyclists have to get used to them. See photo.
OR
2) Alternate street parking from one side to the other once or twice down the block, and bump-out or stripe the transitions with chicanes. The bump-outs could create some nice new planting areas, which neighbors on this block would likely and gladly take on maintenance of. Building them is relatively expensive b/c of the curbing, but they could be striped first as a cheap experiment. See photo in next post.
OR
3) Just allow cars to park on both sides of Barnett, creating what's called a ""queuing street"" - cars have to pull over and wait to pass one another. This latter approach is a new standard for low-volume residential streets in Portland, OR and is the defacto standard on older streets all over the world. This would be cheapest - just some new parking signs. Barnett is roughly 27' wide, just between the 26-28' wide standard for a two-sided parking queuing street.

My name is Meg, and I am a frequent commuter to Southern Connecticut State University from West Haven. Every day when I go to school, I always have to cross the intersection of Whalley Ave. and Ella Grasso Blvd. 

I am writing to you to see if SOMETHING can be done about this intersection. First let’s start how if you are heading towards Southern on Ella Grasso Blvd., there NEEDS to be a designated “left turn” lane at Ella Grasso Blvd and a designated “right turn/straight” lane at this same intersection. I don’t know how many times I have been cut off by other drivers because you have drivers that stay on the right side that go straight and cut you off, or if you are on the right side to go straight, you have drivers on the left side that go straight to cut you off. Confusing….right? I know. Which is why there needs to be these designated lanes to go in certain directions. 

Furthermore, any way we can make the light green longer that faces Ella Grasso Blvd. in BOTH directions? Seriously, the light is green for no more than a minute, and traffic gets backed up during rush hour in the morning and in the evening. 

Perhaps to get a better understanding on how annoying this intersection is, not to mention the problems of this intersection, I am wondering if someone from the traffic division can observe this intersection during rush hour commute (whether in morning or in the evening). I am fully aware that New Haven has other bigger issues, and the personnel of the police department has bigger things to deal with, but it’s a matter of time before a serious accident happens. So many people are cutting people off and/or running the light because it’s too short and people get impatient for waiting at the light for the fifth time in a row. As stated earlier, I have been cut off numerous times, and almost to the point where people were inches away from hitting me head on due to them running the light if they are making a left turn onto Whalley. SOMETHING needs to be done, and any effort to get this problem solved would be greatly appreciated.

I am writing to express my concern for pedestrian safety at this intersection. There are no pedestrian right-of-way crossing lights. A barely visible sign (only present on northbound Whitney Ave.) says that pedestrians cross with green light.

This evening I was almost struck by a car making a turn onto Willow St. as I was crossing. The car had to slam on its brakes and swerve--only missing me by a foot or so.

Vehicles drive much higher than the speed limit on Whitney Ave. In addition, cars on Willow St. tend to stop past the white line denoting the pedestrian crossway (though I see a dozen cars not stop at all on a daily basis).

This intersection is dangerous and needs to have a pedestrian crosswalk button or a law enforcement officer handing out red-light violations.

The current traffic pattern is dangerous and holds up traffic dramatically in the afternoons. From 3 PM (dismissal of school at Fountain & Emerson NW) to past 5 PM (early rush hour & avoiding Whalley Ave. construction) Fountain W-bound gets held up for 2 long blocks. School bus stop signs create a backlog.

BIG PROBLEM #1: This blockage  is on the W-bound side of Fountain btw. Alden and Forest. My building is on Fountain btw. Emerson and Forest. 
The road divider there makes the residents of this block approach from the W-bound side of Fountain. During crunch time it can take up to 15 minutes to get from Alden Ave. to my driveway. When I exit my parking lot at this time, the mandatory R turn depends on the kindness of strangers to let me out bcs. it's solid traffic.

BIG PROBLEM #2: There's no protected L onto Forest Rd. from Fountain St. Many, many people making this turn dive for it on the red, which means into heavy, still-oncoming traffic, bcs. E-bound Fountain has a longer green than W-bound Fountain. This aggravates the traffic congestion.


BIG PROBLEM #3: Traffic N on Forest Rd. backs up for 2+ blocks. At rush hour, cars can wait 10-15 minutes to get to the light.

*SUGGESTION*: This intersection is complicated and heavily travelled. Why not give each direction an exclusive green? 

That would make the traffic pattern (going counter-clockwise): W-bound traffic on Fountain, S-bound, traffic on Dayton, E-bound  traffic on Fountain, N-bound traffic on Forest.

Vista Terrace? Don't know, but there must be a way.

The smell is horrible.  Every time we open the front door. In the summer, we cannot even sit in our porch because of the smell and the bugs.  In addition, every time the dumpster is over loaded with trash, the wind blows the trash to my house and we have to pick up the garbage all the time.  I have two small children and this is not safe for them either.
I spoke with the landlord once and he said he can not do anything, and wants me to find a solution.  
The lot was empty for many years before building the house and this is probably why the dumpster was moved by my fence.  I hope you can help with this issue.

The roots could enter my basement.  It horribly blocks and overshadows my home.  I find leave and branches constantly falling/dropping down.  It's also destroying the sidewalk due the tree's roots appearing to be also under the street as well as the sidewalk.  Many including myself have found it to be an eyesore and affect the value of the properties as well on the street.

In the event that there is a severe Thunderstorm, I've become very fearful for me and my five children of a strike to said tree.   I ask as a very concerned and afraid citizen that you remove the large tree in the front of my home.

On his way to Lighthouse with 6 people on board, he stopped in front of me while I was doing yard work and did some type of hand gesture.  The riders seem perplexed and clearly noted his behavior.  There is no bus stop in front of my house.  No one got off or on the bus at that point.  On his return trip, no riders but in front on my neighbor, I did not make eye contact with him so he beeped his horn until I looked at him.  I would like a written response that you have spoken to this driver specifically.  I would appreciate a written apology from the driver.  If you need to speak to my neighbor, please let me know.  If he harasses me again, I will want to meet with you so that it becomes a permanent part of his job performance record.  

I will not be harassed by a state/municipal employee.  I have asked the bus drivers to slow down.  The speed limit is 25.  They are often going well over 35.  They drive down the middle of the road over the yellow lines and do not make a clear stop at the nearby stop sign.  

That said there are at least 2 women drivers who do obey all of the laws.  I will be sure to get their numbers so they can receive the recognition.

This has gone from asking you through several complaint forms to slow your buses down before they hurt a pedestrian, bicyclist or families on their walk.  This is a residential neighborhood.  But to go from being ignored to being harassed is one step past breaking the traffic laws.

Also as a separate issue, there is no bus stop in front of my house but drivers have been picking up passengers there.  Can you please give them a reminder about bus stops.  There are two less than on each of the blocks on both sides where they are currently stopping.

If anyone on COncord is interested, I am starting a petition to turn Concord back to a safe, residential street.  You can email me at mentalhealthparity101@gmail.com.

Metro-North trains only serve the station on a limited morning and evening basis, with no midday trains to or from Grand Central between 10am and 3:30pm, no trains arriving or departing after 6pm, and no weekend trains.

The New Haven State Street Station is ideally located in downtown New Haven to serve the neighborhoods of Wooster Square and Downtown, which have seen significant increases in population in recent years. With the completion of the 360 State project, there are now also 500 public parking spaces available in a vibrant urban center directly across from the station, making it all the more accessible to commuters.

With residential capacity higher than ever surrounding the station, and a growing demand for more public transportation options, it is time to bring Metro-North full service to New Haven State Street Station.
