353,,"93 Pearl St New Haven, Connecticut",,2014-11-04T11:18:50,"Several weeks ago, the Southern CT Gas company conducted infrastructure works in the entire neighborhood (Pearl, Pleasant, Clark, Lincoln).  The work caused major inconvenience, from noise to a city ban on street parking, but as residents, we understood the need to be patient and the potential long-term benefits of having solid infrastructure. However, when it was time to seal the holes in the road, the construction crew did shoddy work. As a result, the road is uneven, full of poorly filled potholes, cracks and bumps. A simple slow drive to get out of the street has become a difficult and bumpy experience. Like most of my neighbors, I own a simple sedan, not an all terrain vehicle that can handle such a ride. And with small children in the back of my car, the ride has become particularly unsafe. Since Pearl St and many of its adjacent roads  - which were also badly damaged during the construction project- are one-way streets, it is practically impossible to get out of the street and into one of the main roads (e.g. State st, Orange st) without saying a prayer first. I have lived here for 3 years now, and know that the city usually repairs the roads once a year, after the winter has caused its usual damages. I also know that budget is tight. However, I can’t imagine living like this through the rest of the fall and the entire winter.

 There is a long pothole on State Street, just north of Crown Street, where a sewer separation job has turned into a trough.  On that part of State Street many large trucks come barrelling down to try to make the light at George Street and when they hit the trough it makes the buildings near that corner shake.  It also happens when trucks and cars turn that corner from State onto Crown too fast.
