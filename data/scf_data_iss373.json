The left 2 lanes from George, when it was originally 4 lanes flowed well into Fair Street. Now, that the left lane has been changed to go the opposite direction, the new left lane follows onto Fair Street fine. With the sidewalk and curb on the Knights of Columbus museum still in the same place, the center lane now leads you into the curb. Please fix this or only allow the center and right lanes to only turn right as they previously did. This is a problem, where the previous far left lane allowed for cars to turn left without holding up traffic going straight onto Fair Street or creating an unnatural lane shift.

of Prospect and East Rock. Since the issue was closed and I hadn't seen a sign, I walked up to the corner and searched for the sign. Yes there is a sign, but it was placed on the southwest corner of the intersection in such a way that it is totally hidden by a tree from two of the three possible approaches to that corner. In other words, it is not visible heading west on East Rock Road or heading south on Prospect. There is a wooden utility pole on the northeast corner of that intersection that is perfectly visible from all directions. That pole still has the brackets from an older sign. Can't the signs be moved so they are visible in all directions?

I live in Hamden but work in New Haven. I normally drive to work, but would prefer to bike in on the Farmington Canal. \r\n\r\nWhen I last tried this in the fall on a Saturday, the Farmington Canal just sort of ends (is more construction bringing the canal forward?) somewhere near Yale University buildings with no indication of how to get from this (to me) unfamiliar part of the city to where I work (I normally go on the highway), or any information about bicycle routes in the city. \r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is that at the end of the trail (if this bridge area marks the end of the trail) some sort of signage be placed to indicate where you are and how to get to other parts of the city. \r\n\r\nAlso, is there any sort of resource listing existing on-street bike bike paths and bike-separated bike lanes in the area? \r\n\r\nIn other words, once you're in New Haven on a bike, where you can go that's bike friendly? I've heard about shoreline routes under construction, but have no idea how to get there. \r\n\r\nAny advice is welcome. \r\n\r\n", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.9270958900452, 41.3155139639971]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/88642", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/signs.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2011-03-16T09:51:18-04:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/eW3u0w", "updated_at": "2014-01-06T10:10:24-05:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/88642", "summary": "Signage/Directions/Bike Lanes At The End Of The Farmington Canal Line", "flag_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/88642/flag", "address": "10-30 Canal St New Haven, CT 06511, USA", "lat": 41.3155139639971, "closed_at": null, "lng": -72.9270958900452, "acknowledged_at": null, "reporter": {"name": "Andrew Smith", "witty_title": "Street Smart", "civic_points": 0, "role": "Registered User", "avatar": {"full": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png", "square_100x100": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/no-avatar-100.png"}, "id": 0}, "id": 88642, "comment_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/88642/comments"}, {"status": "Acknowledged", "rating": 6, "transitions": {}, "description": "Dead end road sign needed, heavy traffic on dead end road\r\nReported from my mobile device\r\nhttp://m.seeclickfix.com", "point": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-72.9620568, 41.3283708]}, "url": "https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/84000", "media": {"image_square_100x100": null, "representative_image_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/assets/categories/signs.png", "video_url": null, "image_full": null}, "created_at": "2011-02-25T05:52:13-05:00", "shortened_url": "http://bit.ly/efjJGQ", "updated_at": "2013-09-09T15:11:52-04:00", "html_url": "https://seeclickfix.com/issues/84000", "summary": "We need 2 \"dead end\" signs hanging from the light because 500 people must turn around on our street a day.
